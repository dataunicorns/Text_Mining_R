The CNN article went on to state that the school clinic did not administer any medications. 





When I took my daughter's epipen to her school, I was told that they did not have a nurse and it was against school policy for a teacher to administer it.  Luckliy, however, the school secretary said that she would administer it if needed.","1879080",1
"There is no definite answer on this, but maybe the later age of  introduction of peanuts in the USA to children has something to do with it.

I have had to be the one the rx it for the whole damn district. I take all the risk but god damn it if I save one little kid then risk is worth it. I galls me that other districts called to say no allergist would do the rx for the school nurses would I do it? I just couldnt take that risk I have never met any of the RNs there but I thought about it. It is a shame this child died. BTW my wonderful 22 is peanut anaphylaxis child and she has had to have epi X4 in her life. I cannot imagine life without her. Today in fact on vacation she asked that if she died would I have party at her wake celebrating her life not crying about her death!

"We fired a first grade teacher at our private school for failing to respond appropriately to a child's asthma attack.

The boy, who had been in the ICU for several days earlier that year, had a severe attack returning from a hike. The teacher did not have his rescue inhaler, despite explicit directions from the parents that it be immediately available at all times. In fact, she had left it across campus at the administration building earlier that semester.

Another child's parent was along for the hike and sprinted to get the inhaler. When he returned and tried to give it to the boy, the teacher intervened and insisted the gasping, tachypneic child had to *wash his hands* first, with the washroom located in another building a courtyard away. The parent wrenched the inhaler back away from the teacher and assisted the child with it, probably saving his life.

There is actually a law in our state that prohibits school personnel from keeping asthma medications away from children, so long as the medication is properly prescribed by a physician. But most school systems are badly misinformed about proper management of asthmatic or allergic respiratory distress.","1879123",1

Whoever at the school told the mother that the medications should be taken home, should probably be charged with manslaughter, in my non-lawyer opinion. Same goes for whomever refused to give lifesaving treatment to a child with a known medical condition, with a known treatment for this condition, which was available.

Keeping a sane head during a patient's asthma attach is not the same thing as keeping control of/educating  20+ kids in a classroom, very different skill sets.

Great questions!  


First of all, a teacher should not be administering the insulin, that should be the job of the nurse.  The teacher's job should be to recognize a life or limb threatening situation, then call for medical assistance.





Next, if a teacher has too many children with brittle conditions in her class such that she/he is not able to provide proper supervision to ensure that no children die while in class, by him or herself, then he/she needs an assistant.  A well-run classroom, with order and discipline, should make it quite obvious when a child is dying in his or her classroom.  If a teacher is so overwhelmed that he or she can't see a child dying, there is clearly a problem!





And yes, I agree competely that a nurse should not have to jump through five hoops to give a Tylenol!  Wow, I guess things have changed since I was the school physician for a district back in the '90's.  We had pretty straightforward protocols the nurses followed, and never had a problem.  And the buck stopped with me, of course!","1879474",1
"A related thought.... 
It is not that Epi pens Re frequently used. Why can't a school keep 6-7 pens and if one is used then have it refilled by the parent. The copay for pen is sometimes 40-70 dollars and many parents literally cry when they have to buy pens for home and school year after year. Sheer waste of healthcare dollars. Moreover a question for fellow allergists.... Do you prescribe 4 epipens (2 for home and 2 for school?)","1879629",1
"Some patients I do.","1879631",1

"Why didn't the kid say no to peanut?  

Well, probably because she was 7...

My 6 year old has severe nut allergy but it has been 2 years since her last attack, so her memory is fading.  She knows to ask about nuts, but I can completely imagine a scenario she would just forget.  They are still too little to worry about their own mortality. Interestingly, I was paged by her school nurse on January 3rd.  Called back with palpitations.  ""Just wanted to let you know your daughter's epi-pen expired on 12/31/11, you need to bring a new one ""pronto""!""  I guess I'd rather have an overzealous school nurse, but I also hope she would have used the epi-pen even after expiration should something happened!

On the flip side, remember a thread about schools banning peanuts and the outrage it caused among parents of non-allergic kids?  Even here, on Sermo?  Had this school been peanut-free and had all the other parents respected that maybe this little girl would have lived.","1879884",1
"My kid is 5, has never had a reaction but won't even stay in the same room as peanut butter. But, again not trying to blame the victim.","1879894",1
"With the ""no tolerance"" policies in schools today, the administration probably worried that an Epi-pen was a ""potentially dangerous weapon"". The kid probably wouldn't be allowed to possess it on school grounds.


As for the peanut allergy being a new thing, there's been much discussion here of how we've created a society of people who can't tolerate a LOT of things. We've made life so sterile and ""safe"", that when a person has a reaction to a normally innocuous substance, the immune system goes crazy. Think of ""sick building syndrome"". Some people can't even abide new carpeting.","1879951",1
"kid had a known peanut allergy? any responsibility for the parents in failing to tell their kid not to accept & consume a peanut from another kid??","1880184",1
"<sarcasm font>

No the parents have no responsibility.  Can't you see that everybody else, the school, the nurse, theprincipal, the friend who should have known that she was allergic to peanuts, everybody but the parents are responsible.  But not the parents.","1880202",1
"The budget constraint has left a lot of school without a school nurse.  It is too much for us to ask the teacher to be the mother, the teacher , the social worker, and the nurse.  No one would argue that the best way is to have a nurse on campus at all times when school is open.  But this is no longer a reality in many schools. Thus it should be the parents who must teach the child how to treat an reaction (yes they may be too young but then what is the alternative) and talk to the child's teacher individually about the special attention their child may need.  Firing a teacher for having not treated a child's asthma is unfair and not unlike someone firing you as a doctor for not having taught geometry properly to a child. 
I am married to an ex-teacher and can see how much responsibilities they are supposed to bear while being paid relatively little for the job.","1880210",1
"If they can not afford a school nurse, it is because of waste at many levels.","1880264",1
"""...Firing a teacher for having not treated a child's asthma is unfair and not unlike someone firing you as a doctor for not having taught geometry properly to a child...""

Firing a teacher for placing a child's life at risk by breaking state law and ignoring specific directives from parents and physicians about life saving medication availability is completely fair and is necessary to protect the children.

This teacher did not need ""treat a child's asthma"". She simply needed to not make the child's rescue inhaler inaccessible to him - despite clear instructions to the contrary - and to not physically block him from self administering his own medication when needed - in violation of state laws.

There is actually another child in this same class with anaphylactic peanut allergy. Turns out this same teacher was taking the children on hikes to picnic in nearby woods, leaving the child's epi pen behind in a different building across campus. This despite explicit written and verbal instructions from the parents given during a parent teacher conference called by the parents in order to address this particular safety issue. The child knew he needed his epi pen with him at all times and had asked to have it to bring along, and the teacher had refused.

My own child is asthmatic. After our early experience with this teacher we bought jackets and back packs with hidden inner pockets, and she kept her albuterol with her at all times, unknown to the teacher. At least until she was fired. The new teacher keeps the children's medications labeled and in a cabinet behind her desk. When the children are taken on outings, she has a special fanny pack to bring the meds along.","1880488",1
"I must have missed the point, the teacher should not have prevented the child from using the inhaler. The problem may lie with the zero tolerance policy wherein a teacher is placed in a position to decide when and what to allow a child to use a medication given that he/she has had little or no medical training. Yes, it is tragic that any pupil dies or suffers because of this ignorance of the law but one must look at the other side as well.   I recall in one case a student was busted for taking a Tylenol or something like that to school -although this was what the zero tolerance law intended, the ridiculousness of it got splashed all over the paper making the teacher looking like a fool by complying with the law. The major problem is the lack of a school nurse on campus.  Our society has been shifting more and more of the tasks to the teacher in the name of budget cutting and this is unfair to the teacher who have not gone into the profession to be a nurse-substitute.  I would estimate that all of us have broken some fed or state laws in our practice if we get a thorough audit. In fact, there are likely many laws I don't even know of and may have broken. Do you know that we have a law whereby it is prohibited for anyone to dispose of any used syringes or needles in the trash. They were advised to give the trash to their doctors for disposal but neglecting the fact that doctors have to pay dearly for disposing their biologic waste yet the law does not make provision for the extra cost at all.  Anyone who claims that he has compiled with all fed and state laws governing a medical practice please come forward.
Again I emphasize that we need to bring back school nurses to the campus instead of piling yet more responsibility on the teachers who are burning out at a very fast rate.  Just ask any teacher whether he/she is happy with his job and you will get a earful.","1880518",1
"When rules and laws are unjust and irrational, it is the duty of the responsible citizen to make every effort to change the rules.  Failing those efforts, then it is the citizen's duty to engage in civil disobedience. 





How can any teacher, prinicipal, or school system hide behind ""the rules"" while subjecting children entrusted to them by society to preventable potentially fatal risks?","1880554",1

If the government starts to mandate that you provide remedial instructions for all of your patients who are behind in school, how would you deal with this?

"{redacted}, unfortunately what you are describing is simply not anything near reality for many teachers/classrooms.   The school ""nurse"" may very well be the secretary.  I realize that's not an ""okay"" excuse but it sure the hell isn't some individual teacher's fault.  Whether or not there is an assistant (or an extra assistant) in the room obviously involves more than just someone wishing or thinking that there ""should"" be one.  You really can't imagine a well-run and orderly classroom where just the combo of medical needs of different students, individual educational and individual behavioral ""plans"" could be reaching a level of 'ridiculous' as far as what even a GOOD teacher is capable of accomplishing day in, day out?   Your ""teacher shouldn't be giving insulin"" statement is great and seems obvious, but that's like saying someone didn't get appropriate care because they were being boarded in a busy ER and no one should ever be boarded in the ER, you know?

She was instructed to use the epinephrine spray ad-lib if she felt a reaction coming on, inject the epi-pen, then drink the diphenhydramine. Once, her school, even though they knew she was allergic, had a class lunch during which everybody was given a peanut butter sandwich. My wife and I were livid and vocal after that. My daughter checks the ingredients of everything she eats.

My brother has the peanut allergy and has had at least one episode of dyspnea and hives as an adult after eating something with peanuts after being told there were no peanuts in it.

ACAAI: Oral Tx for Peanut Allergy a Viable Option

By John Gever, Senior Editor, MedPage Today
Published: November 09, 2011

BOSTON -- Oral desensitization therapy for severe peanut allergy is feasible in clinical practice as long as patients are counseled appropriately and precautions are rigorously observed, a researcher said here.

At a clinic in central Connecticut, 103 children and adolescents have been treated with slowly escalating daily doses of peanut protein -- including 56 now considered tolerant enough for maintenance dosing -- with only two withdrawing because of unacceptable side effects, according to Glenda Noumon, DO, of the New England Food Allergy Treatment Center in West Hartford, Conn.","1881476",1
"{redacted}, just call Aliso Viejo or Laguna Niguel  high school in Calif and ask the school how much it would cost for a boy to play football there.  The answer will be $2500 or more but that covers extra insurance , uniforms and travels to play the game.   This is fact and not just opinion. 
While you are at it, ask them how much it will cost for basketball.","1881519",1
"{redacted} brought up a great point.  Why can't schools keep a stock of Epipens and not have to have them prescribed for a specific student?  After all the possiblity of a child presenting with anaphylaxis without any prior history is certainly possible.

"Mostly because EpiPen needs be prescribed for a specific person and that teachers are not trained medical people who should decide when or how much to give . This also opens the liability issue for the school once it takes up this extra responsibility.  Besides EpiPen expires after a year and someone will have to check repeatedly the expiration date on the EpiPen since a bad outcome after an EpiPen injection (either too late, not enough, or causing cardiac arrhythmia etc) will be a fodder for a lawsuit as well.  Our education system is one of the worst in the industrialized world and our teachers are burning out very fast because they are over-burdened with so many things besides teaching the subject. Some of them have to buy paper and supplies just to keep their classroom going.   In the final analysis, it is our TORT system which makes it difficult for anyone to do anything no matter how well-intentioned.  
EpiPen is just one issue, once this can is opened, then teachers will be required to be trained to treated diabetic coma or hypoglycemia, epilepsy , concussion etc because the parents would demand equality.      America is a broken country now and we will  a few good men to fix it.","1882738",1

If hives, do w and y, etc.   I see my food allergy kids every summer to go over everything, EpiPens, forms, avoidance, and tell them they need to personally visit the child's teacher at the beginning of the year and make sure they can use EpiPens.  Preferably one should be kept in the classroom, not locked up in a ""nurses office"" in the next building.  The forms also state that anyone can give the EpiPen if trained (which takes 5 seconds to do) and has a place to put the child's picture to speed up identification.  This case breaks my heart.","1882817",1

In the situation of the girl who died at the Virginia school two weeks ago,  the moral and ethical thing to do, which last time I checked was one of the reasons people went to nursing or med school (ethics, helping your fellow man, etc) , would have been for the school nurse to have picked up ANOTHER STUDENT'S EpiPen and injected into the girl who was dying before her eyes of anaphylaxis.  What are the chances that two kids would anaphylaxis on the same day!? Give me a break! What are the chances that the nurse would have been sued had the girl's anaphylaxis reversed and had she lived? None.

"Sabrina's Law


The best-known law concerning the use of an EpiPen is Sabrina's Law, named after a young girl who died from anaphylaxis after eating french fries that had come in contact with food containing dairy. This Canadian law, enacted in 2006, protects students with life-threatening allergies through policies that ensure in-school safety. School officials must be aware of a student's allergy, and training is required of all teachers and other school personnel in the use of an EpiPen and other emergency procedures.





Schools in the United States


The school environment can be a dangerous place for someone who suffers from severe allergies. Like Sabrina, a child with a severe food allergy does not necessarily have to consume the allergen to experience a reaction. If a child's food has come in contact with the allergen, or another child is eating that food and then touches the skin of the child with the allergy, an allergic reaction may be triggered. Therefore, it is particularly important for a child to have access to her EpiPen at school. All but five of the 50 states have laws allowing students to carry and self-administer an EpiPen at school. Only New York, Rhode Island, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Michigan do not have such laws in place.





Details concerning how the EpiPen should be carried in school and who can administer it varies from state to state. In some states, all school personnel, including bus drivers, are trained in how to use an EpiPen.","1884789",1
"Yes, Sabrina's Law is a great law.





I disagree with the notion of ""leave it up to the states"".  Yes, I am a Republican and a Southerner and so of-course I like states to have as much autonomy as possible, but I also know that in the case of a no-brainer good law like this is, it is stupid to wait until all 50 states pass the law, b/c that could take five years!  It takes a motivated allergist to get  up off his butt and get involved in the legislative process, and that allergist is not making any money doing that. It took a lot of my time, and of course I could have been in the clinic making money but instead I was spending time emailing people and going to the statehouse for committee meetings. Even though I am in the prime of my career trying to build a practice, and there are a lot of allergists near retirement age who have accumulated wealth and have their vacation homes, they obviously were not motivated to get off their butts and help get a law passed.  So, it is unrealistic to think  50 states will get the law passed quickly. For example, it may take North Dakota eight yrs to get the law passed. 





To make a blanket statement and say, ""let the states do it just b/c they can"" is not always the right thing to do for the people of this country.  After all, if the federal gov't had done that, then school integration and Jim Crow laws would have lasted about TEN MORE YEARS, maybe more, if it were left up to the states without any federal government strong persuasion and laws.","1885115",1
"I understand your time statement, but the cry of ""its for the children"" has saddled us with more Federal crap over the years.  No more, time to go back to the Constitution and 18 powers.  If it is a great idea, it should not be hard to get it passed.  Look at things like Jessica's Law regarding predators.","1885143",1
"What is sad is that there should need to be laws to ""allow"" citizens and neighbors to exhibit their natural beneficence.  Who would not help a child in respiratory distress?





The problem we have is that we have a shitload of OTHER laws that choke the beneficence out of anyone so inclined. 





The solution is not to make more laws.  The solution is to repeal the laws that are limiting our ability and tendency to act with beneficence.","1885207",1
"OK people, every state in this country has Nursing Practice Laws that forbid them to administer a prescription drug without a doctor's order. Do you want to do away with that whole law, or you do you want to make an exception and allow a school nurse to give an EpiPen injection to a person who is anaphylaxing even though there is no prescription on-file?  Most doctors would want the latter. The most logical thing is to make a legal exception for an epinephrine administration via an ""auto-injector"", and that's what about four or five states have already done, and that's what the federal government will probably do this year so that we don't have to wait ten years for all states to jump on-board and sign a law. More and more kids will die if we let every state just sit back and wait until a motivated allergist like myself tries to pass a state law.","1885383",1
"As I said - we are all tangled up in our own laws.  Maybe we can make another law to untangle it?","1885612",1
"Epi pens are designed to be administered by the patient. Why can't a school official give it? If epi is given to  a child who is NOT having anaphylaxis, nothing serious will happen.

I think one solution here is that the child needs to carry, and know how to administer, the epipen.

Did anyone call 911? How about an immediate call placed by cellphone from the playground.

Why have a school nurse?","1885808",1
"Training for epi pen use: 1) take off the cap. 2) press against the thigh.

It's pretty complicated but I think a school nurse can do it.","1885819",1
"How young a child would you entrust with such self-administer instructions?





Obviously, the age of the child matters.  Of course, a 10 year old could do it.  Perhaps even an 8 year old.  But....the rules in some schools do not allow children to carry and administer their own medications.","1885843",1
"{redacted}, 911 is usually quickly called in cases like this, regardless of whether or not the kid is given epi at school or not. But anaphylaxis usually causes death within 40 minutes of symptoms onset, and it may take 15 mins for ambulance to arrive, and the kid may not have c/o symptoms until 10 mins after sx. onset, so there goes 25 mins right there.





Also, some children who have known h/o food or insect allergy DON'T HAVE AN EPI-PEN stored for them at school that is ""dedicated"" to them. This for several reasons--lack of due diligence on the parent's part and also perhaps occasionally slackness on the school infirmary's part. The mother of the deceased 7 yo stated, according to the Internet rumors, that she REQUESTED THAT THE SCHOOL KEEP AN EPI-PEN IN HER CHILD'S NAME, but that some school employee said, ""Nah, we don't need to do that"". ( I am only quoting the Internet rumor here) I find it hard to believe a school employee would be that moronic to say that, but keep in mind, many school ""nurses"" have never received one day of actual medical education.  





Also, most children under age of 10 yo are not mature enough to inject themselves with epi.





Also, oftentimes, the person's FIRST allergic reaction, either to insect sting or food,  occurs at school, so there is no dedicated epi injector or prescription on-file at school.","1885911",1
"On the food action I believe it says if the child should carry the epipen or be left at front desk.","1886057",1
"The main purpose of this new law that hopefully will get passed by the Senate and not vetoed is to cover the people who DON'T  have an EpiPen stored at school in the infirmary or passed around the classrooms, for whatever reason-- 


#1) never had an allergic reaction


#2) Have a diagnosed h/o food allergy, and the doctor did everything he could do-- wrote rx for EpiPen, anaphylaxis action plan-- but kid has  a bad homelife with parents too irresponsible to adequately inform the school and provide them with an EpiPen,


#3)  have a bad school employee who is so incompetent and uneducated that she or he tells the parent, ""just leave the EpiPen at home"", etc, 


#4) saw a bad doctor who failed to diagnose past symptoms as food allergy and/or failed to presribe an EpiPen,


#5)  have a child who may carry the EpiPen on his /her person but does not have the papework, action plan on -record at the school and is too fearful to use it


#6) have a child who carries EpiPen in bookbag but bookbag is locked up in locker and kid is too panicky to give out his locker combination, and kid does not have EpiPen stored for him at the infirmary with an action plan.





The possibilities can go on-and-on about why a person may not have EpiPen stored for him in the school infirmary and does not have an EpiPen ready-to-use when he need itl-- in locker, in another classroom, left on the bus, whatever-- that is  ready-to use.





That's the major point of this law-- to allow schools to STOCK epinephrine auto-injectors that are ""undedicated"" and can be used on anybody in need.","1886094",1
"I like that. Having an Epi-pen available at schools, just like having an AED. Eventually it WILL be needed by someone.


And yes, using an Epi-pen is pretty much fool-proof.


 (Although full disclosure: I had an anaphylactic reaction to an antibiotic while I was at work, slipped and accidentally injected my thumb while getting it ready. My thumb turned white and cold and stayed that way for a couple of days. Stupid me!)","1886443",1
"The primary problem is the lack of a school nurse.  It would seem simple to us as medical people to know that giving EpiPen is an easy task, yet many errors as still made in using the device by lay people even after they have been instructed on how to use it. 
The problems a teacher faces are many and as one of the commenters noted that in a day's encounter with up to 160 or more students, many of them have medical conditions which may need to be addressed as well.  In addition to this, they are now adding students with learning disabilities to the regular class, so that teacher has to deal with their needs as well. 
This is in addition to preparing the lessons, teaching the class, correcting exams, dealing with demanding parents, meeting the special needs of neglected children etc. This list is endless. I would urge anyone who wishes to put more burden on our teachers to take their place for a day and see how much work there is.  There must be a thousands laws regulating a teacher's day and we are only seeing mostly from our perspective.    I do think EpiPen , like many other things. should be readily available. But please don't place the onus on the teachers.","1886547",1

"The federal Senate bill, along with the state laws in Georgia and Illinois, do not place any onus on any particular school employee. Au contraire, the laws actually remove the onus of worrying about which school employee is allowed to give epinephrine. The law says that ANY school employee can give it. The law does not say ""teachers are the ones to give it"", or ""the school nurse must give it"". Keep in mind, many public schools do not have actual nurses working there in the infirmary. They have women with no medical education working as ""UAPs""-- Unlicensed Assistive Personnel"" in -charge of the student infirmary/health.





This law is all about freedom, not about placing burdens on anybody.    Let any school  employee be able to inject epinephrine (of course, as long as they know how to).  If the janitor knows how to use it b/c his daughter has peanut allergy, then that's fine if the janitor injects it.   This is a device that we train 12 year olds to use on themselves; certainly an adult school employee who knows how to use it should be able to use it to save a kid's life, regardless of whether or not the adult has a nursing degree.","1886811",1

"{redacted}, yes, sometimes parents are at-fault in certain situations.


But, if a kid has an anaphylactic reaction to peanut THE FIRST TIME at school, then how can the parent be held in any way culpable of not having an EpiPen prescription for the kid?","1887593",1
"The potential source of lawsuit would be that the EpiPen was not given on a timely basis due to lack of recognition and then death or brain damage occurred as the result.  When treatment is mandated by law, then improper treatment may be consider malpractice. Thus it must be accompanied by a good Sumaritan law to prevent lawsuits. In our legal system , the person who acts loses even he wins (because of the time, expense, and emotional stress involved)","1887722",1
"{redacted},  the Georgia law has a ""Good Samaritin clause"".   I am pretty sure the federal Senate bill also has a Good Samaritin clause.





I don't think the law would open up the potential for lawsuits in the situation of a school employee not giving epinephrine to student with no h/o food or insect sting allergy.  The law probably does make school employees more culpable in situations where the student has a known h/o allergy-- either on-record at the school in-writing or simply the student's spoken history at the time of the reaction-- like ""I have peanut allergy, and I am having a reaction now b/c somebody gave me peanut and I accidentally ate it b/c I was not paying attention.  I need epinephrine now but, no, I don't have a doctor's signed form at school b/c I forgot to bring the form last year to the school"" and if the kid is too young  administer EpiPe himself, then somebody else needs to inject it.  If that kid just said that and starts wheezing and getting tachypneic and face turns blue, and no school employee gives that kid epinephrine, then Yes, I  think the federal Senate bill/law would make the school more responsible. And heck Yes, the school should be held more responsible if they refuse to give that kid epi just b/c there is not a signed anaphylaxis action plan and dedicated epi injector kept for the kid.





But the purpose of the bill is to save lives, not protect teachers and school administers from lawsuits. By not passing the bill, some children will die over the next ten years, and if one makes the ole ""this bill will make we teachers and nurses more responsible"" argument that I had to listen to multiple times last year, then that is letting the trial lawyers really screw things up making a good, life-saving law not get passed.","1887760",1
"Isn't there a saying that "" the road to ruins is often paved with good intentions"".  I admire your efforts cracker and believe in what you are saying , I just want the school employees protected as well while trying to  do a good deed.","1887819",1
"The school employees have full protection in my state according the law that I passed in-terms of they cannot get sued b/c they gave epinephrine to a kid who appeared that he might be anaphylaxing but really wasn't.  Also, the law does not force people to give epinephrine to a student who is anaphylaxing. It merely says, ""you can give it"".   Does that mean you can get sued and lose a case if you don't give it? Maybe you can, but if the kid has no h/o allergy to that food, and the kid is not telling saying ""I'm allergic to this food or that food"", and the kid is anaphylaxing to something, then I don't think the school employee would lose a case for not giving epinephrine, but yes, the law would make the school employee look worse for not giving it. But it really depends on who the school employee is: if the school employee is employed for the specific purpose of providing and assessing HEALTH, then yes, that school employee would lose a lawsuit in that situation.  But, if that school employee was a teacher, and the teacher called 911 and there was no health-care employee at the school for the teacher to take the kid to, then No, I don't think the teacher would lose a lawsuit for not giving an epi injection IF it was a situation consisting of the student having no h/o allergic reaction.

in NJ, the law allows a school nurse and other designated teachers to hold and administer an epipen, although usually the school tries to get you to sign so that only the student carries it and agrees to administer it during an emergency (not really possible when you are SOB and hypotensive, in my opinion.)  it has take persistence but we have been able to make it work.  

our HS school nurse, who is a pretty gutsy former ED charge nurse, was wise enough to administer someone else's epipen to a child who suffered a bee sting reaction.   bravo to her, but many would not have the guts or sense to do that.

re: {redacted}'s comment (( #2 surely everyone has noticed that the airlines don't hand out peanuts anymore. How long until those who cannot tolerate gluten succeed in banning the pretzels too?))  
COME ON!! pretzels and gluten allergy are not life threatening.  sorry for your inconvenience.  
imagine needing to check what you eat every single minute of your life.

my daughter came home from college for winter break and spent every single day baking, since she has not been able to eat any of the desserts at the dining hall.  we try to keep her stocked with treats, but she really missed being able to eat desserts.  but she understands how  life-threatening her allergy is and how quickly it can progress.","1891694",1
"I did a brief stint as ""school nurse"" in a private school when my kids were little...Many parents of allergic students provided an epipen for the nurse's office, the kitchen and the classroom. We had allergy protocols and yearly inservices for the teachers so they all knew how to use an epipen. The epipens went on every field trip in a fannypack prepared by the school nurse. Allergy awareness and preparation takes away some of the fear for teachers and chaperones. I would not have hesitated one second to use another child's epipen in a life-threatening emergency if his own was not available. We would have worked out the details with the parents later...","1891739",1

"Aisen and {redacted}, I get the impression that you are annoyed by some allergists and people who want schools to be be better prepared to prevent deaths from allergic reaction. Rather than using sarcasm, which does not communicate one's true feelings, I encourage you to please write down exactly what you feel regarding how you do think school's should handle systemic allergic reactions:





1) Do you think all schools should continue to have the policy of BANNING the use of EpiPen in any person who is anaphylaxing but does not have a written order on-file at the school saying that Johnny can use epi on himself or that a school employee can inject it into Johnny?  





If you do think it is a good idea to continue that policy, which is the policy in approx 45 states now, then pleae explain why you want to continue the status quo of not letting school employees give an epi injection unless there is a prescription and/or doctor's order/anaphylaxis action plan on-file at school for that student to receive epi ?   What if your SON OR DAUGHTER had  systemic allergic reaction to peanut FOR THE FIRST TIME at school and was gasping for air and short of breath, or what if he was stung by a yellow jacket on the playground and was gasping for air and losing consciousness?  Would you want the school nurse, or the school employee just to call 911 and sit there and watch your child or grandchild go downhill while you are waiting on the EMS to arrive, even though there is the CURE for that potential fatal reaction sitting two feet away from you in the medicine cabinet.   





Are you actually OPPOSED to the federal bill that would allow school employees to give an epi injection to someone who is having anaphylaxis/systemic allergic reaction to any student, regardless of whether or not there is a prescription on-file for that epinephrine?  What is the downside to that bill?   What bad things will come of this bill?   Please share your concerns with us. I was personally responsible for having this bill passed in my state, so I certainly welcome to hear  anyone's reasons for an opposing point of view.","1892580",1

Do you think the recognition of anaphylaxis is very difficult?   Do you think the school probably did NOT have any other EpiPens at the school.","1892586",1
"{redacted} - your comments make complete sense to me.  The notion that it is even a conversation shows just how litigious our society has become.  It is common sense to allow the use of someone else's Epipen for a life-threatening situation.  But, unfortunately, we live in a world where people think that anything not done by the book should result in a payout that is tantamount to winning the lottery.  How ludicrous is it that the ""right"" thing to do under the law is to watch a child die, when it could have easily been prevented.  And, I agree, the laws need changing because this is a good samaritan gray zone.  School nurses are not passersby, and the whole school may be deemed the nurse's ""clinic"" if you will.  Because of that, traditional good samaritan rules may not necessarily apply.  Hell, you can get a lawyer to sue for anything.  Just sad that's what it's come to.  I was in Chicago when there was a shooting in the hospital parking lot.

"Does anyone think that the mother could have been more assertive here? If my child had a life threatening allergy,  I can't imagine knowingly allowing my child to be in an environment where I know emergency medicines aren't available.

"{redacted}, all we have to go on, unless a doctor on Sermo personally knows the mother of a school employee, is what we read on the Internet in articles, blogs, chat rooms, etc.   

The mother claims that she told the school that she wanted an EpiPen kept for her child at the school to be used in case of an emergency. The mother claims that some school employee, probably the one in charge of student health, which could have been a licensed nurse or a non-nurse working as the school ""nurse"", said, ""No, just keep it at home, we don't need that"".  Frankly, I find that hard to believe, b/c I had never heard of a school nurse or non-nurse school health worker refusing to keep an EpiPen for a student until I heard this story.

But look, the main point of the law is to PROTECT THE CHILDREN FROM THEIR PARENT'S STUPIDITY AS WELL AS THE SCHOOL EMPLOYEES STUPIDITY AS WELL AS A DOCTOR'S STUPIDITY AS WELL AS TO TREAT A CHILD WHO IS HAVING HIS FIRST ALLERGIC REACTION.   You cannot blame a 7 year old for the improper logistic handling of the EpiPen issue between her mother and the school employee.  Either the mom or the school employee messed up, or both of them messed up.  If Virginia had a law like a few other states have and like the law that is coming up in the Senate now, that school nurse could have just given the kid epinephrine right then and there, and PROBABLY the child would be alive today.  It is very rare that anyone dies of anaphylaxis if epinephrine is injected within 10 minutes of a systemic allergic reaction. 

You just can't rely on everything working out. The law is meant to keep the kids who fall through the cracks alive-- these are kids who may have their first allergic reaction at school, or kids who, for whatever reason, don't have the EpiPen stored for them in a proper place at school.    

Drcbgmd, you must practice in Alaska. That's the only state that I know of with a law like you describe.

Like I said, there is no tangible downside to the law.  We will never find out the exact details and assume them to be true in the Virginia case of the 7 yo child. Schools usually clamp down in the face of an impeding lawsuit. Regardless  of the details, we need a law.

The law in no way removes parental responsibility or removes responsibility from anybody. It is simply a law that allows a person at school to receive the ONLY life-saving intervention in the face of an allergic EMERGENCY.  Giving epi injection is really BASIC FIRST AID.","1893378",1
"""...Frankly, I find that hard to believe, b/c I had never heard of a school nurse or non-nurse school health worker refusing to keep an EpiPen for a student until I heard this story....""

"{redacted}, I agree with you completely.  I was just pointing out that in my mind the mother's attempt to blame the school (which I know may or may not be true, and probably isn't) STILL places much of the blame squarely on the mother.  





We're speaking here of a child with a known life threatening allergy.  She should not have been allowed to go ANYWHERE that mother KNEW the medications weren't available.  It was Mom's responsibility to clear this problem up in some way before sending her to this school, at least as much as it was the school's responsibility to allow access to lifesaving medication.    If what Mom says is true, it wasn't a safe environment for her child and mother knew it.... well in advance of the poor girl's death.  Even if the mother is not lying, she still bears a significant portion of the blame here.  She failed to ensure the safety of her child to the best of her ability.





I just get so tired of parents' who try to blame others (ie the government) for their own failure to take personal responsibility for the welfare of their kids.





Of course, I'm not blaming the child.  And, I agree, if the school had a supply of epinephrine that could be given to any child as needed, even those with a first attack,  this would not have happened. Or if they had used someone else's epinephrine.   And I agree, often kids do need to be protected from the stupidity of their parents and others.

The kids can't get the insulin shot(substitute with any other med) in time, it's the school's fault.   I agree that the school should do its best to protect the students, but everything has a breaking point when being burdened excessively.

Both universities, colleges, and elementary/mid/high schools are bloated with administrators and pencil-pushers who don't actually teach.   That's one reason university and lower school tuition is so high. It's not b/c college professors are getting paid tons more than they used to. It's b/c there are twice as many non-professors who are on the university payroll.and there is an insane number of departments that really could be consolidated and therefore trim the administrators. For example,  why isn't African-American Studies incorporated into the History Department or Sociology Dep'ts at many schools?  Instead, African-American Studies is often its own department, with its own secretaries, administrators, etc. There's nothing wrong with a major in African-American studies, but why do we need a separate department?  Also, Classics Dep't could be combined with History Dep't.  But I digress.","1894780",1

"I have reservations about the ""epipens everywhere"" law. I am concerned that the costs are underestimated and the benefits overestimated:





1.  Even if we had epipens in all schools the decision of when to use one can be difficult. As some of you know (because I posted it) I went to an ER last year with an acute reaction to tree nuts. The ER docs and I debated the epi and decided not to. Some of you disagreed with the decision. It made me quite aware of the difficulty a child and a school nurse, let alone a teacher, would have in assessing the severity of a reaction.





2. Would the law protect someone who made the wrong decision either direction? You DO understand that if giving it was protected but NOT giving it might be penalized, then thousands of epi shots a year would be given unnecessarily. 





3. I have 3 decades of experience dealing with evolving willingness of school nurses to deal with hypoglycemia in diabetic children. Severe hypoglycemia during the school day is as rare as life-threatening anaphylactic reactions.  Even if a parent supplies glucagon to the school, the chance of it being used appropriately is at best 50%. People find IM shots frightening and many will not do it even when a child is having a seizure in front of them-- they will call 911 anyway. It never occurred to me to tell parents to sue them for not doing it right because 50% of parents fail to use it appropriately at home even after we have instructed them. The other thing that happens if parents make a big deal out of glucagon or epipens is that their children will not be allowed to go on field trips or will be restricted to certain schools because that's where the school nurses are. I suspect glucagon is even safer than epinephrine, but less than 50% of trained adults will use it correctly the first time their own child needs it.





4. You say that epinephrine is very safe. But one of our educated docs above mentioned an adverse reaction. If 1000 unnecessary shots are given, how many adverse reactions will occur, and what kind? At the very least there are going to be panicked, tachycardic visits to ERs and thousands of dollars spent almost every time an epipen is used. Even a 1 in 1000 risk of harm from an epi shot would begin to match the actual number of anaphylaxis deaths prevented by this expanded policy, wouldnt it?





continued below","1915633",1
"5. The cost of epipens is not trivial, nor is the cost of making them universally available. I was shocked at the cost when the ER docs and some of you persuaded me to buy one. Not so much at the cost of the single pen but at the expiration in less than a year and the surprising inconvenience of actually carrying it. So it sits in my bedroom and will never be used and i will go back to what i've done my whole life-- ask carefully about the contents of all food. How many of you allergists have demanded more compact and longer lasting epi preparations on behalf of your patients?





6. I grew up with eczema, asthma, and peanut/tree nut and dog and cat allergies. There is a social cost to the child to make a public issue of these. I knew from the earliest years of elementary school that i could not eat nuts. I carried an inhaler in my pocket everywhere i went, but no one used epipens in those days. I remember  unkind comments about my inhaler or my restrictions-- not many, but kids remember them. I can only imagine what it would have felt like if someone had told my classmates they couldnt bring certain treats to school in case I got a whiff of it. 





7. What will these children feel like when the legal risk to the adults around is amplified by this law? The normal response of an adult to a suggestion that they might have to treat a life threatening problem by giving a shot is to want nothing to do with the child. Do you know how hard it is to get a babysitter or even daycare for your diabetic child if you are foolish enough to demand the babysitter or daycare worker learn how to give glucagon for the 1 in a million chance that it might be helpful? Even some grandparents will refuse to take a diabetic child if parents make too much of the child's risk and fragility and need for emergency readiness.





8. So I suspect the dollar cost of universal availability will be far, far more than the $5 per taxpayer mentioned by someone above. Even if we don’t count the social cost.





9. And tell us again the number of children who die at school from allergic reactions each year? And what proportion would be saved by greater epipen availability?   





Intelligent physicians are not allowed to say stupid things like ""it doesnt matter what it costs if it saves one child"". Requiring a taxpayer-mandated depression evaluation every 6 mos for every teenager by a school psychologist would save more lives, wouldnt it? Kids are killed in schoolbus accidents each year that could be prevented if the roads used by the schoolbuses were blocked for other traffic during those hours, so why dont we do that? Why dont we have paramedics and an ambulance statiioned at every playground during recess?

"{redacted} if you look at what i actually wrote, I am not questioning the efficacy of epinephrine nor its superiority over oral benadryl, nor your motives. I asked simply for a risk/benefit analysis:





1. How many children (and adults on school premises) currently die at school each year due to food or beesting anaphylaxis? Call this number D. My suspicions is that D is low single digits, but the data must exist. Is it more than 1 child a year? And am I right that 90% of fatal anaphylaxis occurs in children already known to be allergic? 





2. Then how many of these children would be saved by an epi pen in the school office? This depends on both the availability of epipens and the willingness of average school personnel to give them. Lets call this number L for Lives Saved. Ideally it would be nearly as high as D, but I have my doubts that it would be even 10% of D unless large amounts of time are invested in continual training and that incentives and disincentives are aligned to increase it. Could L be less than one person a year?





Now let's calculate cost:


(1) Direct dollar cost of annual ordering stocking of at least one epipen per school. Wait, would you want big and small doses? Would you want it in more than 1 location? Would you use some pens in real training? Maybe $50 per pen for this? Wait, it needs to be in a locked location, but accessible, like a fire extinguisher. Not loose in a drawer in the nurse's office. Let's assume we can get better price but we spend at least $200 per school. There are about 120000 schools in the us. Why not throw in preschools and colleges to get us to 200,000 and 4 million direct cost dollars? 





(2) Indirect dollar cost would involve all the hours of all the people figuring out policy on these things, and training, and lobbying for changes to medication laws, figuring out how to balance the incentives and disincentives for use, and publicizing the availability. Indirect dollar cost  would include the costs of liability insurance and the rules required by the insurance companies.  I cant even begin to guess,.





(3) Indirect academic cost would involve the loss of all the other things school personnel might do instead of training, tracking, replacing pens, and in making sure the allergic children are well-identified and in explaining the policy to teachers and then dealing with parents.





(4) indirect personal cost to the allergic children would involve whatever restrictions schools put on where the children can go and what they can do. Use your imagination. Must eat with an adult instead of their friends? Cant go on field trips. Special school buses with trained drivers? No more brought-from-home food for anyone in the school? Maybe the allergic children could be required to wear red shirts so adults could more readily recognize coughing or wheezing that might be anaphylaxis? If the school doesnt take federal money can they just decline to enrol the child, like some private schools refuse to take diabetic children? From my own experience I do not think these are negligible costs to the children, but we can't factor them in quantitatively. And of course we are saving their lives.





(5) Risk of adverse effects from untrained people giving epinephrine. What do you think? My suspicion is that significant harm might occur with at least 1% of injections, which is certainly an acceptable risk if most of the injections are given to those who would likely die of anaphylaxis, but my suspicion is that anything you do to raise the ratio of shots given to real anaphylaxis will raise the ratio of unnecessary injections as well. Even if the stuff is safe as saline, you know that no one will give the shot without also calling 911 and incurring a several thousand dollar trip the to the ER.





So how many millions of dollars do we spend per life saved?


If all you do is place epipens in secures places in every school and dont tell the parents, lawyers, and administrators, maybe you can keep the direct dollar costs down to $4 million and the pens will never be given to anyoine inappropriately. But without publicity, training, and changes of laws and insurance, you know the actual likelihood of a random school employee giving an IM medication injection when it would be beneficial is less than 10%, such that it might take years for L to reach even 1.





I dont mean to be critical of your passion for saving a child's life, {redacted}, but I think the cost per saved life is going to be many orders of magnitude higher than you were suggesting. So it comes down to a value judgment about how much security can we buy for how much money.





On the other hand, dont laugh, but do you think the cost would be more favorable to requiring all licensed restaurants to stock a large and small epipen?","1916682",1
"PS, what set me up for reacting this way was recently reading Freakonomics and Superfreakonomics by Levitt and Dubner. Despite the stupid titles, the books are fascinating. The second one has a lengthy discussion of the public health and cost benefit ratios of seat belts and car seats (you may be surprised at how different the cost per life saved is-- many, many millions of dollars more for each life saved by child car seats than for seat belts). There is also extensive discussion of how to get people to change behaviors in this type of setting (including getting doctors to handwash) and how to analyze this type of issue. The first book has a good discussion of how bad people are at calculating risks of rare events-- but i assume all of you help your patients understand the difference bewteen likelihood and dreadfulness when discussing risks.





I promise you that you could not read the latter book without thinking about this epipen issue entirely differently.","1916815",1
"Who gives a rip about the cost?  This is not some sort of health screening issue where we are trying to figure out if Medicare or private insurance companies spend more money on screening that money saved from diagnosing a disease early.





If a parent wants to donate 75 dollars to the school for them buy an EpiPen, let the parent do that!   Maybe  a cheaper device will come out that is just as easy to use as EpiPen. Let the free market sort it out.





All the law does is ALLOW a school nurse to give EpiPen injection to a kid who may not have a prescription on-file at school for whatever reason and/or may not have his own, personal EpiPen at school for whatever reason. The law does not force schools to BUY new EpiPens. The school nurse could pick up another kid's dedicated EpiPen and then inject that into a different kid who is anaphylaxing. Then, the school could simply ask the parent of the kid whose life was saved to pay 75 bucks to the kid who just got his EpiPen used up!","1917115",1
"Forgive me if i misunderstood or overthought this. You are correct that a law that says that a nurse may legally give an epipen shot to any child suspected of anaphylaxis if she has a pen available but no prescription would be inexpensive and all the concerns i raised above would be irrelevant.





Except for two:


1. Would it increase the lawsuit vulnerability when someone fails to do it? Dont you think a lawsuit is already in the works over the death in Virginia? What if there had been a law that the nurse could have given the available epipen injection without breaking any law? Would she be more or less secure from a lawsuit? Do you think the school lawyer would be pleased to hear that not only was another epi pen available, but the nurse could have legally given it?


2. And if no other provision is made for training and expectation, I doubt the L/D ratio would hit 0.1. In other words, I suspect it would be years before this would save a single life. But it would cause little harm or cost, so i withdraw my objection. 





Interesting exercise though, isnt it?","1917185",1
"Why have AED's then ?","1917543",1
"I don't give a rip about whether or not a school's lawsuit vulnerability is increased.  All I care about is saving lives. If one life is saved  by this law, and ten schools are sued and lose a lawsuit, which is more important-- a person's life or ten schools losing a lawsuit? Would you rather your son be alive b/c of this law or would you rather a school not lose a lawsuit.





If anything, the net effect of this law will be to PREVENT lawsuits from being brought against schools.  





Boy, you are pessimistic, {redacted}.","1917612",1
"Using an epi pen on a person with a history of anaphylactic reactions having some sort of breathing problem, having a ""bad"" reaction and dieing seems exponentially less likely than not treating them,  causing needless suffering and anxiety and even death.","1917663",1
"{redacted} summed it up nicely.





Anesthesiologists recognize the good safety profile of IM epinephrine!","1917761",1
"I didnt intend to start a fight, or cause offense to {redacted}. A couple of things should be obvious.





First, of couse i would wish for any person suffering from anaphylaxis to be given epinephrine. I dont question its value or extremely favorable cost benefit ratio in such a situation.





Second, I AM pessimistic that such a law even if adopted in all 50 states, combined with putting at least one epi pen in 200,000 schools would save a life per decade, if that is ALL that is done. But once you start doing more than that, the costs and risks rise dramatically.





Third, you cant simply say, ""saving one child is worth any amount of money and man-hours and anyone who questions that is crazy or a bad person"". People die every year for lack of access to organs, or just medical care, problems that would be fixed by simply saying ""money is no object if we can save one life"". That is not the way the world works. I gave you several proposals for things that might save a few lives a year, but would have prohibitive costs or very low acceptance.  





Perhaps I am wrong. 


I would be wrong would be if i am greatly underestimating the number of children who die at school each year of anaphylaxis. 


I would be wrong if i am greatly underestimating the proportion of these children who would be saved epi if pens were simply put in schools with minimal training. 


Cant any of you who disagree with me give us some sort of reported estimate? If 20 children a year die at schools from anaphylaxis, and only 10% would be given epi with this new law, I would probably vote for it. But none of you have offered alternatives to either number.





And it is not irrational or a character flaw for me to ask these questions. We spend our lives making these kinds of decisions and tradeoffs and thinking about the benefit and cost of a public health measure is a reasonable thing to do. Its like answering objections to complaints about the TSA by saying ""it's all worth it if they save one life"".","1917829",1
"Yes I understand your points.





And no, we don't have good data on deaths per year from anaphylaxis, and we often dont' have reliable details on what exactly happens at schools in some cases of death b/c SCHOOLS CLAMP DOWN AND DON'T REVEAL ANY INFORMATION b/c there is often a lawsuit pending.





This year, a girl in Virginia died, largely b/c she did not receive an epi injection at school, for various reasons.  Last year, a girl in Illinois died, again, she probably would have lived has someone given her an epi injection at school.   At least once per year, a kid dies at school from a'laxis in the U.S. In 100% or almost 100% of cases, the school staff recognize that the kid is having anaphylaxis, but nobody injects epinephrine b/c there is no signed physicians' order at school to receive epinephrine and no epinephrine assigned to that student, or someone anaphylaxis for the first time at school. Don't you think it's pretty stupid for a kid to die when the nurse has what-could-save his life in her desk drawer but does not use it b/c the state laws and school policy prohibits a nurse from using it on a child, even if that child is dying and choking to death from laryngeal closure?





Again, do you think we should not pass this law because you think it hurt the American economy or cause a major deficit in school budgets?





 I understand there is a large responsibility in parent's part and kid's part to aid in preparing for allergic emergencies, but how do you account for a first-time a'laxis at school or a situation where the idiotic school health personnel told the parent, ""No, we are not going to keep EpiPen here for your child"" which is what the mother of the Virginia girl claimed happened.","1918012",1
"thanks {redacted}. You are confirming what i suspected in terms of numbers. My suspicion is that whatever insurance industry insures schools is likely to have more exact numbers, but 1-2 a year sounded likely to me based simply on how rarely we hear of it, how much news it makes when it happens, and how little drive there has been to reduce it.





Of course i have no objection to having epipens in schools, nor making it easier to use them.





 My first point was that the potential expense per life saved would be very high-- many millions of dollars, because of how low the numbers are and how difficult it would be to get adults to use them properly. I stuck my nose into this topic because I thought I had several types of experience that qualified me to add something: I grew up as one of those allergic children-- one of your patients-- and recently had an anaphylactic food reaction where we had to think using epinephrine and then I had to think about carrying an epipen, and I have spent 30 years trying to teach parents how to give seizure-stopping injections and helping parents negotiate with schools and school nurses about emergency injections at schools-- perhaps as much as anyone else involved in this discussion--, and lastly because I just learned a bit about how to look at public safety crusades in terms of effectiveness and cost. 





I didnt intend to disparage anyone's admirable zeal for saving children's lives. But none of you has offered any reason for me to change any part of my analysis of this, have you?","1918477",1
"{redacted}, it just all depends on how much one considers one life is worth.  I agree with you that for every school in the country to buy 1 EpiPen 2-pack per year, that would be a huge cost for very little number of students (and adult school staff) who would benefit from it.  I am not disagreeing with your point that it is a huge cost if you add it up nationwide for a very small number of people who would benefit. But come on, if your son dies because the nurse sits there like a potted plant and does not give him epinephrine just b/c there is no doctor's on-record at the school even though he is anaphylaxing, would you still say, ""that's OK, because the law that would allow school nurses to keep undedicated epinephrine in their little school nurse room would just drive up the cost on a nationwide basis to an unnecessarily high level, so I'm not bitter, it's for the greater good American society and economy that no such law was passed"".","1920961",1

To eliminate the ability of allergists to make allergy shot extracts in our offices just b/c a CROOKED COMPOUNDING PHARMACY in New England had contaminated medicine that caused fungal meningitis in pts receiving this med via the epidural route is UTTERLY RIDICULOUS!  





{redacted}, the term ""serum/sera"",pertaining to the field of an allergy,  is an antiquated term from the early-to-mid 1900s referring to allergen extract.

"Dear Sirs or Madam,





I have decided to write this letter to discuss my opinion on the mixing of allergy shots in Allergist offices. I have been doing allergy since the early 80's. In my experience I have never seen one case of cellulitis due to an allergy shot. We have had patients receive a symptom of large local reactions to the allergens themselves but in my whole 32 yrs of administering an allergy shot clinic I have never seen a true case. I have sent allergen for culture exactly twice in all these years and the culture and gram stain was negative. 


Of course the people pushing for this will state that this is only one allergist opinion and thereby should be discounted. Validity of observation is directly proportional to the number of observations so let me clarify my experience.





1984 to 1987  = 6 fellow and 6 attending with 200 shots per week volume


1987 to 1990 = 2 attendings as solo allergist in Quad Cities 600 shots per week volume


1991 to 2016 = 5 providers as very large group in Chicago giving 600 shots per week volume





This observational study documents as a conservative estimate I have been privy to information on almost 1 million allergy shots in my career. This is no small number and I believe in any statistical analysis would make a normal doctor or patient comfortable with receiving an allergy shot without concern of infection. 





In our practice only one RN does the allergy mixtures under sterile conditions, alone in the office on Sunday without any other duty. She has done this for 21 yrs without one error nor contamination. 





Where pray tell is the pandemic of infections from allergy shots that is prompting this costly, unjustified, self righteous, overly complicated set of rules? 





Today we all practice what we like to call ""evidence based medicine"". We do not run in panic from undocumented fears or possible problems. We study and issue and then make intelligent choices. I am the Chief of Staff in my hospital and have done peer review for 8 years prior to that with over 100 hours of Quality Improvement and lots of time looking at Performance data. I know what I am saying when I say we do not have a problem with contamination of allergen extracts.

"I would also make the case that allergy immunotherapy has been shown to be a cost effective therapy as it is done currently.  The main alternative to allergy immunotherapy would be omalizumab and mepolizumab, which have not been shown to be cost effective.

"I just sent this to compoundingSL@USP.org:


I support the exemption of allergy immunotherapy (ie allergy shots) from the proposed USP rules on compounding pharmacy operations.  I have been in the practice of allergy and immunology for over 30 years.  Allergy shots are given as weekly to monthly injections for 3 to 5 years.  Allergists use FDA approved materials, which are usually mixed in the office to keep the cost of therapy reasonable.  The allergy vaccine is usually made with no more than 10 separate allergens in 1, 2 or 3 separate vaccines.  Cost effectiveness has been shown in multiple studies by reducing the need for other medications, ER visits, urgent care visits, and hospitalizations for asthma, anaphylaxis, and rhinitis.  The main alternative to allergy immunotherapy are other biologics such as omalizumab and mepolizumab, which are far more expensive.  For example, the current cost of mepolizumab is $2500 per injection or $30,000 per year versus $2000 to $4000 per year for allergy immunotherapy.  Sublingual therapy is not currently a practical alternative, since there are only 2 allergens: grass and ragweed.  Most patients are allergic to other allergens such as dust mite, animal dander’s, cockroach, trees, or molds.  There are no sublingual therapies for bee sting allergy.


 


The proposed rules would at least double the cost of immunotherapy to $4000 to $8000 per year, and would make allergy immunotherapy no longer as cost effective.  Many allergists would cease compounding allergy vaccines in their office and switch to commercial compounding pharmacies, that typically take months to prepare vaccines instead of days.  There would be breaks in therapy that increase the risk of anaphylaxis and lower adherence.  The proposed rules do not solve any current problems, because unlike intrathecal injections of steroids, infection has not been a problem with the subcutaneous administration of allergy immunotherapy.","4583578",1

{redacted}, you will be proud of me: I did not use the 4 letter word...








REQUEST TO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT USP EXCEPTION FOR ALLERGEN EXTRACTS





 	 For the reasons below I request that the United States Pharmacopeia (USP) maintain the current exception for allergen extracts (CSPS section, page 17-18, USP chapter 797).


Within in the past fifteen years, I have used allergen mixtures from a commercial compounding pharmacy only once, early in my career, due to circumstances beyond my control when I was working part-time at another allergist’s office.  The turnaround time was 2 ½ months, due to sterility testing and quality assurance and control issues.  When the vials finally arrived at the office, the patient’s name was totally misspelled on the vial labels.  The cost was 2 ½ times more than those allergen mixtures made at my office, and the insurance covered only a small fraction of the cost.  


The turnaround time of commercially prepared allergen vials is clearly not acceptable, in particular for patients with seasonal allergies.  When skin testing, prescription and preparation of immunotherapy are all performed at one location, the probability of mistakes with mixing and labelling is much less than when these tasks are performed at different locations, and by different entities.  The current turnaround time in my office is 24 hours or less.  Commercially prepared allergy shots will more than double the costs.  Also, discarding sterile extracts every 28 days is unnecessary, unreasonable and will surely drive the costs even higher.


The sterility of allergy immunotherapy vials prepared with aseptic technique is backed by more than a hundred years of clinical practice.   Allergists mix FDA approved materials with aseptic technique.  In 15 years of immunotherapy in my office there has not been a single case of infectious cellulitis due to allergy shots.  In contrast to OTC remedies and biologics, immunotherapy is the only treatment available to modulate and desensitize the immune system, leading to remission of venom and environmental allergies.   Efficacy and cost effectiveness have made immunotherapy out of the allergists’ office a very successful and accessible therapy for allergic conditions, including asthma, rhinitis, conjunctivitis, sinusitis, venom allergies and anaphylaxis.


Shifting the preparation of immunotherapy from allergist offices to commercial compound pharmacies will result in the loss of a very cost-effective, successful therapy that is currently provided to millions of allergy sufferers.  


In sum and substance, the proposal to shift preparation of allergen extracts to commercial pharmacies is without merit, is not justified and is an example of attempting to fix a non-existent problem.

Dear the esteemed members of the United States Pharmacopeia,


I work at a busy allergy office and we have over 150 patients’ currently on immunotherapy regimens and I can tell you from personal observation and patient reported testimony that it is an absolute godsend for these patients. At our allergy office we are not just in the business of treating our patient’s allergies, we are in the unique and wonderful business of the betterment of their quality of life. 


Just the other day I had a patient explain to me that before beginning her immunotherapy, she would get sick—without fail—every 6 weeks and since being on the therapy she has not gotten sick once! She shared with me how her quality of life has improved so much that she recommends Immunotherapy to any and all allergy sufferers she meets. We also have several pediatric patients on immunotherapy who, since receiving treatment, are now able to play sports and participate in events that their allergies previously made impossible. How can we put a price on the incalculable benefit of belonging, of being part of a team? We have other patients with severe pet allergies who, since receiving treatment, are able to pet their cats and play with their dogs again; relationships that have been scientifically proven to improve the quality of our lives. 


	We have been successfully mixing and storing antigens in our office for many years. We follow strict and sterile standard operating procedures—implementing aseptic techniques—when mixing, handling, storing and injecting immunotherapy and as a result we have yet to see any infections from the immunotherapy injections.


	Immunotherapy is the final step in our comprehensive approach to allergy treatment which begins with an in depth consultation, astute skin testing, intradermal testing and concludes with the doctor creating an individualized immunotherapy recipe specially designed based on each individual patient’s specific allergies. The beauty of this approach is that our severely allergic patients are able to begin their regimen and start experiencing relief in as little as a few days and the reason this works so quickly is because we are able to safely mix and securely store the antigens in the convenience of our own office. 


If the USP implements its proposed action it would render us unable to prepare and administer this very effective and proven treatment in our office directly causing unnecessary pain, suffering and discomfort to many patients.  


I know that the distress of our patients would be needlessly prolonged if they were not able to receive this treatment so promptly, efficiently and consistently in our office and it is on their behalf that I write this letter. Please do not cause our patients unnecessary suffering by denying them access to this very effective and proven method of treatment. It is with great compassion and urgency that I implore the USP to maintain the current allergy exception for allergen extracts.  


Thank you very much for your time and consideration.


Yours most sincerely,

Abstract


Objective: To determine the in vivo allergenicity of two grades of peanut oil for a large group of subjects with proved allergy to peanuts.


Design: Double blind, crossover food challenge with crude peanut oil and refined peanut oil.


Setting: Dedicated clinical investigation unit in a university hospital.


Subjects: 60 subjects allergic to peanuts; allergy was confirmed by challenge tests.


Outcome measures: Allergic reaction to the tested peanut oils


Results: None of the 60 subjects reacted to the refined oil; six (10%) reacted to the crude oil. Supervised peanut challenge caused considerably less severe reactions than subjects had reported previously.


Conclusions: Crude peanut oil caused allergic reactions in 10% of allergic subjects studied and should continue to be avoided. Refined peanut oil did not pose a risk to any of the subjects. It would be reasonable to recommend a change in labelling to distinguish refined from crude peanut oil.

The allergists  in our state would disagree and as I know from  decades ago the refined product is probably safe . How on earth can you tell in advance what is actually being used  in a  restaurant or especially a fast food place  , or what is in a container  in the grocery store ?


I read a recent article that 90% of extra virgin olive oil  from Italy is mislabeled  due to Mafia control. If you have seen the Godfather  films , remember they had Mafia consultants 





I know this from attys for the peanut industry. You have a  problem , I  like  peanuts  and I mostly cook with peanut oil since it has a desirable flavor and a  high cooking heat point . However, you should continue efforts to genetically modify the peanuts to eliminate  the undesired antigens . Of course then, they might not grow as well and the tree hugger   nuts will be after you for franken food.

Bamba is a snack food that usuallly is fed to babies as early as 4 months. It is a peanut butter dissolvable corn snack that babies teeth on and eat. It is essentially non chokable because it dissolves in saliva but it packed full of peanut butter. It is the equivalent snaack food to Cheerios in the States.

"Food Allergies & Restaurants","309605",1
"The word “allergy” has been around only since 1906, when Austrian pediatrician Clemens von Pirquet coined it to describe altered biological reactivity. It didn’t gain traction until the mid-1920s, when it took on a big-tent definition describing reactions to everything from food and insect stings to mold and hay fever, says medical historian Matthew Smith, author of the new book Another Person’s Poison: A History of Food Allergy. For most of the 20th century, research-focused “orthodox” allergists, who insisted on a definition requiring a measurable immune reaction, battled with more flexible food allergists, whose main focus was bringing relief to their patients’ hypersensitivities.





The peanut wars of the 1990s brought heightened visibility to the battle. In 2009, Massachusetts led the nation as the first state to require restaurants to undergo allergy training, followed by Rhode Island.





A year later, Paul Antico, a former Fidelity portfolio manager from Cohasset, started AllergyEats, a Yelp-type website, and now also an app, where customers rate restaurants based on how seriously they take allergies. As the father of five, three with food allergies, Antico wanted to give families the freedom to eat out without paralyzing fear. The site now has tens of thousands of user reviews of restaurants from around the country.





Allergy advocacy culminated with the 2013 law signed by President Obama — whose older daughter has a peanut allergy — pushing schools to stockpile anaphylaxis-combating auto-injecting epinephrine EpiPens.





Today, an estimated 4 percent of American adults — or around 10 million — are believed to have food allergies. The percentage is higher for children, 5 percent or more, although many kids will outgrow allergies to milk, egg, wheat, and soy. The other four biggies — peanuts, tree nuts, fish, and shellfish — are more likely to endure. Catering just to the gluten-free subset (technically, celiac and gluten sensitivity aren’t allergies) represents an estimated $23 billion-a-year market.





In his presentation to restaurateurs, Antico argues that appealing to the allergy crowd can pay off in dollars and cents. The market, he says, is much bigger than just people with diagnosed allergies. He cites a Journal of Allergy and Clinical Immunology study that found a whopping 30 percent of Americans believe they have a food allergy.


Still, even he acknowledges the excesses. “There are people who fake allergies, and that stinks,” he says. “We, as the food allergy community, have to be respectful of what the restaurant goes through and be thankful that they’re willing to slow down the entire machine on a busy Saturday night to address our needs.”





Munoz-Furlong stresses that consumers need to know the harm they’re causing when they phrase their food preferences in the form of an allergy. Not long ago, she laid into an acquaintance who had told their waiter, “I am allergic to peppers,” then confided to Munoz-Furlong, “I just hate peppers.”





“People have to understand why it took us so long to get restaurants up to speed,” she says. “It was like getting an ocean liner to change course. We don’t want to go backward because the restaurant industry can’t trust that people are really being honest.”

Right now, just one of the burgundy-and-cream banquettes is occupied, though soon all 88 seats will be filled. The tiny kitchen is already humming. It takes hours of prep work for a restaurant with an ambitious menu to run smoothly on a busy night.





The little black ticket machine in the kitchen spits out a takeout order for a chicken dish. In red block lettering, the ticket reads GLUTEN ALLERG. As special requests go, this one is easy. The machine will occasionally produce a ticket with so many allergy notations in red that it stretches as long as a supermarket receipt from a stock-up-and-save sale.





Every time the cooks see the word “allergy,” they have to assume the customer’s condition is life-threatening. The big danger is cross contamination, where an allergen is inadvertently transferred from one dish to another, often through a shared cutting board or utensil, or through the oil in the fryer or even food dust in the air.





That means with every allergy, the action must stop in this kitchen jammed with cooks and dishwashers. The cooks consult a printed breakdown of ingredients in each dish to make sure the allergen isn’t hiding out in a component. They either grab new cutting boards, knives, and tongs or put theirs through the sanitizing dishwasher. And when the plate is done, they use disposable wipes to hold it by the edge.





Imagine doing that repeatedly across a breathless night, disrupting the choreography of the kitchen each time. I asked numerous chefs how many tables have a diner asking for these special accommodations on a typical night, and I heard estimates ranging from 10 percent to a jaw-dropping 60 percent.





Now imagine that a diner whose “serious dairy allergy” required you to take all those time-consuming steps decides to finish her meal by ordering ice cream, telling her server that it’s OK if she “cheats a little.” This, Leviton says, happens all the time.





He has no problem if a customer says, “I’m not eating gluten” or “I’m avoiding dairy.” The kitchen will make sure those ingredients aren’t in the dish. But they won’t be wasting time taking unnecessary steps. “We’re jumping through a different level of hoop,” he says.





Still, he stresses that people must have realistic expectations. If they come in with no early notice, proffering a card listing “15 different things they’re allergic to,” he says, “there’s not an awful lot we can do on a Saturday night at 7:30.”


Moreover, Leviton emphasizes that, as much as they work with extreme caution, they don’t cook in a vacuum. “We make bread in the same tiny kitchen we make everything else in,” he says, noting that it’s not as if the kitchen is being steam-cleaned to remove all flour dust. Most people who are “super-hyper-allergic,” he says, would stay away from restaurants because they know that just one tiny mistake could prove fatal.





That fear of a customer being carried out on a stretcher forces chefs to be vigilant. But the growing worry is that, as they run around addressing the needs of exaggerators and outright fakers, they might slip up on a customer with a genuinely deadly allergy.





Is it any surprise that more and more chefs are hitting their boiling points?





Kenny Shopsin, the cantankerous owner of the famed New York diner bearing his name, has bragged that when customers tell him they’re deathly allergic to something, he kicks them out, only to hear many confess that they’re not “that allergic.”





This frustration with fakers has occasionally led to recklessness. Recall what a former cook at the Tavern on the Green in New York’s Central Park copped to a few years back. Alleging that customers’ gluten problems were all in their “disturbed little heads,” Damian Cardone boasted he had made a habit of secretly giving anyone ordering gluten-free pasta the normal stuff with gluten and that they were no worse for it. (He seemed clueless that the most serious damage that celiac patients suffer takes place over time, not immediately.)





Then there was the waitress who posted an anonymous screed on Reddit that went viral. It began: “A server will never say this to your face but we all know your gluten allergy is fake. . . . You are just on a gluten-free diet and want attention.” When I track down the author, Chelsea Welch, she admits she had written the post in frustration, after witnessing too much nonsense as a waitress in an Italian restaurant in St. Louis.





The 21-year-old former waitress, who was once fired from Applebee’s for exposing a pastor as a tip cheapskate and who now goes by the name Ferris McEvoy, describes being a server as “a balancing act between pleasing the customer and not pissing off the kitchen.” Because servers are so dependent on tips, customers who make unreasonable requests “are dangling the server’s pay in front of them.”","4701425",1
"Lately, the allergy pushback has been coming from more prominent quarters.





At the end of last year, as the European Union prepared to enact a law requiring restaurants to disclose every possible ingredient used in their meals, 100 of Europe’s top chefs joined forces in protest. “It’s a total fiasco,” former BBC MasterChef winner Thomasina Miers told the Telegraph, noting that she herself suffered from a serious allergy. “It’s the responsibility of the allergee to ask, not the restaurateurs to list.”


Closer to home, some restaurants have begun using surcharges to call the bluff of fakers.





Paul Overgaag, chef-owner of back-to-back Harvard Square restaurants The Red House and Charlie’s Kitchen, has found the upcharge can be an effective deterrent. If a customer says he’s got a dairy allergy and the accompanying starch has dairy in it, he will be offered a substitution such as a salad, for a couple of bucks extra.





“If you’ve got a serious allergy, of course you’d be willing to pay,” Overgaag says. “But at least two to three times a night, the word comes back from the customer: ‘I’ll just have the starch with the dairy in it.’ They don’t want to pay for it.”





Leviton, whose success at Lumiere has long rested on the combination of high-quality food and service, hit his breaking point a few months ago. He told his staff that while they should continue to meet reasonable requests, they would begin saying no to customers more often.





For example, to cope with the spike in diners claiming garlic allergies, he had been holding off on adding the garlic until the very end, so it could be easily eliminated. But because a dish will be more flavorful when garlic is added early on, he concluded he was penalizing the many to please the few.


“We had crossed over and were making too many accommodations, and it was adversely affecting the majority of the customers,” he says.





These days, diners who report a garlic allergy will learn that the garlic cannot be omitted and will be encouraged to select another dish.





Leviton says this “recalibrated” policy hasn’t produced many complaints. “If we’re offending someone by not being as accommodating as they would like,” he says, “we just might not be the right place for them.”





IN THE ’90S, fat-free diets were all the rage. But people didn’t go into restaurants announcing that they were “allergic to fat.” So what has caused this tremendous spike in allergy claims?





It starts with a bunch of self-promoting, self-appointed “experts” dishing out lousy advice.





Consider Dr. Andrew Ordon, one of the stars of that inane The Doctors syndicated TV show, who offered viewers this kernel of wisdom when they dine out: “Probably the only guaranteed way to avoid that butter is to say, ‘Garcon, I have a bad butter allergy.’ ” How did the other talking heads on the panel react to this serving of nonsense? With approving nods and exclamations of “I like that!”


Then there’s blogger Vani Hari, who calls herself the “Food Babe.” Her dubious advice includes this gem: “Go so far as telling your server you’re allergic to butter and dairy, soy and corn.”





Dr. John McDougall, who peddles his low-fat, high-starch McDougall Program diet as a way to prevent degenerative disease, kicks it up a few notches, urging his flock to paint a picture for their servers. “Tell them you’re allergic to oil. [Say] ‘If I eat oil, I’ll have an anaphylactic reaction. I’ll have a seizure. You’ll have to call the ambulance. It will just be a whole big bad scene here in the restaurant. . . .’ ”","4701428",1
"Medical historian Matthew Smith says that on top of all that bad advice, there’s this reality: We’ve stomped out most major infectious diseases, leaving us with hard-to-treat chronic illnesses. Because diet is the one variable people feel they can control, they tinker with it. Some of them end up medicalizing benign conditions through self-diagnosis, swapping tips and drawing affirmation from online communities. That helps explain why so many Americans believe they have a food allergy and act on it without ever going to the doctor to confirm the hunch. (It might also help explain the excesses of the current landscape, where a Massachusetts prep school recently found itself sued by a couple who accused officials of ignoring their complaints about their son’s allergy to the school’s Wi-Fi signal.)


And then there are the diners who simply thrive on attention. They’ll announce that they don’t see anything they like on an extensive menu and ask the chef to make them something special. There’s no more surefire way to ensure your dietary desires are met these days than to invoke an allergy.





But restaurants are not blameless in this dance of deception. Culinary Institute of America professor and author Ezra Eichelberger is a leading voice on all things front-of-the-house. For too long, he says, too many restaurants tried to talk diners out of their preferences (“You’ve never had garlic the way our chef uses it”) or outright lied to them. They might, for instance, fail to disclose to vegetarians ordering the French onion soup that it was made with beef stock or neglect to wave pescatarians off the clam chowder because it has a little pork hidden in it.





This behavior is irresponsible. Tragically, people still do die from allergic reactions at restaurants, though with heightened awareness and plentiful EpiPens, less frequently than in the past. A 2011 review found all food allergy incidents to be responsible for about 200,000 emergency room visits a year, though a study tracking anaphylaxis deaths over the last decade found that less than 7 percent involved reactions to food. (Most were caused by reactions to medication.)


Eichelberger recognizes how out of whack things have become. When big bus-tour groups come in for a meal at the CIA and people start rattling off allergies that they failed to mention in advance, the staff will make accommodations — for a $10-a-plate surcharge.





Nothing, he says, has fueled the recent explosion of allergy complaints like gluten. At a National Restaurant Association trade show not long ago, Eichelberger quipped: “I didn’t realize that celiac disease was contagious. It seems like everybody is getting it.”





WE WERE NEVER meant to eat gluten.





That’s the favorite refrain of gluten-free warriors.





It’s true, says celiac expert Alessio Fasano, that in the 2.5 million years since our ancestors took their first bites, we’ve been eating gluten for only about 10,000 years. However, he stresses that for thousands of years, most people have been eating it with no problem. And gluten-dense wheat made possible our transition from hunter-gatherer life, where we spent almost all our energy on food procurement, to agriculture, which enabled creative work, like building the Colosseum or inventing the computer.


In his book Gluten Freedom, Fasano notes that the first hint of celiac disease in the medical literature came nearly 2,000 years ago. A Greek physician named Aretaeus described a condition that involved “suffering in the bowels.” There was silence in the literature for the next 1,800 years, before British physician Samuel Gee in 1887 correctly diagnosed this malady of chronic indigestion as malabsorption caused by some unnamed foodstuff. Gee’s solution for his patients was less spot-on: He advised them to make sure the bread they ate was thinly sliced and toasted.





Fasano trained at the University of Naples, a hotbed of research on celiac disease, at the time associated almost exclusively with European children suffering chronic diarrhea and other gastrointestinal problems. He tells me he came to the United States partly “to get away from celiac.” Yet when he arrived at the University of Maryland in 1993, he couldn’t accept the prevailing medical view that celiac basically didn’t exist in this country.





Proving his intuition would consume a decade of his life. (Diagnosing the disease is cumbersome, requiring both blood tests and intestinal biopsies.) By 2003, he showed that 1 out of every 133 Americans — about 1 percent of the population — had celiac. It had been hiding because many Americans didn’t have the classic GI symptoms, but rather problems like anemia, joint pain, and chronic headaches.","4701432",1
"Imagine the exhilaration felt by these long-suffering patients who finally had an answer for their debilitating pain. Imagine their outrage at learning they had been hastening their deaths by unwittingly feeding themselves something that had been turning their bodies against them.





They became powerful evangelists about the perils of gluten.





But it didn’t take long for health-food hobbyists and diet-peddling hucksters to overrun the relatively small pool of celiac sufferers. And the “We were never meant to eat this” historical argument made their pitches all the more persuasive. That’s particularly true in the current climate, where we have become so estranged from our food and suspicious of the agribusiness behemoths supplying it. (While Fasano says pesticides may be a factor in rising rates of gluten intolerance, he sees no evidence for the popular claim that our wheat is substantially different from what it’s been for the last couple of centuries.)





That’s the backdrop to a recent study that found 11 percent of American households are following a gluten-free diet, even though only a quarter of them said they were doing it because of celiac or gluten intolerance.


The gluten-free spectrum is diverse. About 0.3 percent of Americans have a wheat allergy, meaning that ingesting even a trace amount could send them into anaphylactic shock. Then there is the 1 percent with celiac. Finally, there are people with gluten sensitivity, who suffer symptoms like diarrhea, bloating, or fatigue after eating gluten. Given the absence of diagnostic tools, the size of this last group is particularly fuzzy, though Fasano’s research suggests it’s in the 5 to 6 percent range.





Fasano is troubled that so many people are diagnosing themselves with gluten intolerance, changing their diet without ever going to the doctor. “You don’t say, ‘I’m drinking a lot and peeing a lot, so I must have diabetes,’ and then start injecting yourself with insulin.”





There is no cure for celiac or gluten sensitivity, and, unlike some allergies, people won’t outgrow the problem. So the only solution is to exclude gluten from the diet. That means going gluten-free is a therapeutic intervention, Fasano says. “It is not the South Beach diet.”





Many who go gluten-free find themselves feeling better and see that as proof that they have gluten intolerance. But a genuine gluten problem is only one of three possible explanations for their improved health, and statistically the least likely. Another reason could be the placebo effect. The most likely explanation is that paying closer attention to diet and avoiding fried and junk food — which tends to be loaded with gluten — is bound to make anyone feel better.





What’s the big deal if gluten-tolerant people go gluten-free, especially since they’ll be eating fewer Pop-Tarts?





The problem is the more these bandwagon-jumpers demand special attention, the more likely that restaurants and wider society will come to see all gluten-free people as phonies.





And by the time the fad-followers move on to another fad diet, they have cheapened the label for all those people who can’t move on.





The label is already becoming comic shorthand. Jimmy Kimmel and Seth Rogen have both mocked LA gluten-free proponents who actually have no idea what gluten is. (When pressed, Rogen’s character in This Is the End hilariously describes gluten as a “vague term” meaning “things that are bad,” like calories and fat.) The Onion offered up the headline: “14% of Americans Now Intolerant to Word ‘Gluten’. ”





With so many posers, people with celiac have to do a bit of acting themselves.





Dr. Sheila Crowe, a specialist at the University of California San Diego, has begun advising her celiac patients who eat out to spare no details in telling servers how dangerously ill they will become from gluten.





Fasano now gives his celiac patients permission to use the word “allergy” to describe their disease, since that will probably be taken more seriously.





He marvels at how quickly things went from no one believing gluten was a problem here to today’s gluten phobia. “To define gluten as this devil we have to fight,” he says, “is a real stretch.”





As he leans into his office chair, a gag box of Gluten Flakes cereal perched on the bookshelf above him, I ask Fasano, “Do you ever sit back and think, ‘What in the world did I unleash?’ ”





He smiles wearily. “Yes.”

But as far as the need for an EpiPen - ask yourself this: how would you feel if he had fatal anaphylaxis, and you didn't have an EpiPen? You'd feel pretty bad, right?





Sounds like you still have some work to do on that denial. Get the pen.","4730332",1
"Sorry, that stinks, poor guy. I'm not an allergist but I've been told that past reactions don't predict future reactions- next one could be anaphylaxis. It's worth it to maintain the epi pen.  They follow the rast as a marker for how severe the allergy I think, if it goes down to a certain level you can try a food challenge. If that's not right I'm sure someone can correct me. ","4730358",1
"RAST is no longer done - the correct terminology is ImmunoCAP. Some experts feel the level of specific IgE to peanut may correlate with severity of reaction. A better (and much newer test) is peanut component testing which can identify the specific peanut allergens to which your son reacts.

"Well, and he needs to know all this.  The problem isn't simply one of avoiding peanuts in the home.

"Thanks everyone for your comments.  RAST testing is what the lab slip says. The issue with hazelnut is if I touch it, if anyone touches me after eating it I get hives. I guess my point is that there are many things in the world that do this to me, including lots of different fruits and plants, so why has no one suggested an epi pen if there's no way to predict future reaction?.  I guess I think that the risk of anaphylaxis for both of us is pretty low and so neither of us really needs an epipen.

How does rast testing (or whatever we shall call it) help in this case?","4730715",1
"Peanut can be one of the most serious reactions so even though he has not had anaphylaxis yet, I would still prescribe an Epi pen because we are dealing with peanuts.

"The lab slip is incorrectly written. As I posted above, there may be a correlation between higher IgE levels and risk for systemic reaction. The better test to assess this seems to be a peanut component assay for Ara h 1,2,3.","4730897",1
"My local lab has automatically performed ImmunoCap even if RAST was ordered in error. Call your lab and verify. Also find out if component testing is covered by your insurance as around here patients have paid $$$ for that test. Getting the blood work done may help you decide if you need an EpiPen around him. Being a physician you may be able to administer epinephrine from the single dose vials rather than the expensive auto-injectors.

"A few comments, maybe ask the allergist why the plan of only hazelnut and peanut. I know your history but with food allergy in families it doesn't pan out consistent like that, other allergens are just as likely..

Definitely needs Epi-pen, why would you think risk of anaphylaxis low when hives developed from just contact? What if is was an ingestion? And these happen all the time, there are people who forget what they put in baked goods, even labels have been mislabeled, not worth the risk. I just had a teenage go into shock when she bit into a granola bar that had no outside label, was not thinking. I am not sure why hazelnut and not other tree nuts recommended on RAST testing.

There is a theory -- I don't know if it has been confirmed -- that if one first encounters a potential allergen via mucous membranes, the risk of sensitization is dramatically decreased.  That is the basis of drinking goats milk from goats that have eaten poison ivy, and the observation that people who eat mangos and raw cashews (both of which contain urushiol, the same allergen as in poison ivy) rarely become sensitized to rhus.  Conversely, if the first exposure is through glabrous skin, the sensitization risk is increased.





Peanut oil was used in some baby skin care products.  Might that have caused the spike in peanut allergy?","4752697",1
"Really good questions, folks, and the experts are still debating all the possible causes of our current peanut epidemic. The best explanation appears to be a twist on the so-called hygiene hypothesis whereby we have so thoroughly sanitized the environment and so strictly avoided allergenic foods that our immune systems have shifted to predominantly Th2 responses which drive allergic sensitization to higher rates. It is definitely a puzzling yet concerning situation.","4752820",1

","4752842",1

Several international studies have shown that early introduction of peanut into an infant's diet reduces the risk for future sensitization, but once a child has become allergic then s/he must avoid peanut protein to prevent reactions.

I am disabled, and like every other disabled person I have ever known, am insulted by these crazed laws.  We have no objection to being asked pleasantly about the nature of our disability and being offered help. And we suffer far, far, more by selfish healthy people using the scarce handicapped facilities like parking places because dumb lawmakers have seen fit to encourage such abuse of scarce facilities and protect the unscrupulous,  and we ever do from being asked to establish our right to use them. 


Of course guide-dogs and similar specially trained and valuable animals with specific, definable functions, should be given special exemptions and facilities.

And where are the boundaries ? May I have a therapeutic cow ? carry an empathic lobster with me ? perhaps a few sympathetic slugs in my laptop case ? 


I whole-heartedly agree with my excellent colleague who identifies these animals as the symptom of a patient whose narcissism and inflamed sense of special entitlement is being encouraged by daft laws and daft doctors writing letters of support,  probably rendering the patient's underlying illness, if any, untreatable and incurable.

If you can take the dog into the passenger area on a plane, you avoid the fee to fly the dog in a separate pressurized area, and the time to drop off and pick up the animal, especially if you only have carry-on luggage. If you're going for a long night out, and your dog doesn't have a strong bladder, you don't have to either hire a dog-sitter or risk finding a ruined carpet on your return home. Or maybe your dog's just not well-trained- like the example cited it the OP- and you'll return to chewed-up furniture, messed-up papers, etc.

WHAT IS A THERAPY DOG?


 





Therapy dogs are dogs who go with their owners to volunteer in settings such as schools, hospitals, and nursing homes.





From working with a child who is learning to read to visiting a senior in assisted living, therapy dogs and their owners work together as a team to improve the lives of other people.





Therapy dogs are not service dogs. Service dogs are dogs who are specially trained to perform specific tasks to help a person who has a disability. An example of a service dog is a dog who guides an owner who is blind, or a dog who assists someone who has a physical disability. Service dogs stay with their person and have special access privileges in public places such as on planes, restaurants, etc. Therapy dogs, the dogs who will be earning the AKC Therapy Dog™ title, do not have the same special access as service dogs.





It is unethical to attempt to pass off a therapy dog as a service dog for purposes such as flying on a plane or being admitted to a restaurant.





Hope this clears things up a bit..

"Service animals are specifically defined in the law.  Many states have their own laws defining the consequences for fraudulent misrepresentation of a pet as a service animal.  In many states, it is a misdemeanor punishable by 6 months in prison and a fine.  Dogs off leash wandering unsupervised and obviously untrained for service in places of business are a danger to others.  They have been known to jump up and knock people down on the ground, harming them, for just one example.  The facts presented in this case  show that this restaurant visitor with a pet running amok in the restaurant was clearly in violation of the laws, including those for breach of peace in having taunted and bullied others in the restaurant about their allergies. In more than 30 years of practing medicine, I have never met a truly disabled individual who attacks others' for having health vulnerabilities.   Did you consider, as a restaurant patron being bullied and in danger from a dog running amok, calling the police yourself or asking the bouncer to do so to protect you and your rights?  Perhaps you preferred to simply enjoy your meal, but I'll bet it was tense and stressful under those circumstances.  Do consider that option in the future,  if confronted with such egregious abuse of the valuable laws protecting those with legitimate disabilities and trained, documented service animals.  Laws must be enforced to be truly meaningful   Inform yourself about the laws so you can work with business owners and the police if necessary to stop such fraud and abuse.  Well-informed business owners know that they are allowed to ask for proper  documentation of a medical reason for the service animal (a credible letter from the person's physician who sees them for regular healthcare and a credible description from the individual claiming the dog performs a service), and proof of legally required vaccinations and dog licensing.  The airlines and hotels are generally well-informed on this matter and do not hesitate to inspect documentation.  As a first step in informing yourself, look at any airline's website for written policies on travel with animals, and then check the laws in your own Town and State, as well as those under the ADA.  Knowledge is power.  Cooperating with the policing of those who fraudulently abuse these laws protects our patients with legitimate health needs.  ","4813378",1

Most of what you say is true, but here are some clarifications.





There is no requirement that an ADA service dog be identified with any special vest, collar, uniform, or license. They can be completely unadorned.





The leash exception is not only for epilepsy. The leash exception is for any condition in which the lease, harness, or collar would interfere with the service that the animal is trained to provide.





Emotional support animals (""therapy pets"") are covered under federal law in two settings, and those are apartments and airplanes. Under the Fair Housing Act, a landlord must accommodate a person with a mental disability and their support animal if a licensed medical professional says that the animal is medically necessary. And under the Air Carrier Access Act, airlines are similarly required to accommodate people who have a companion animal that has been deemed medically necessary. There are no other laws at the federal level that say anything about emotional support animals. State laws may vary.

That said, service dogs are like animal versions of medical marijuana. It's a total sham. Basically, people will just say they have something and need it for something (mild anxiety, centering of chakra), whatever, it doesn't matter, to get them ""serviced."" I'm not sure what docs are allowing this, but if I were in practice, I wouldn't. Anyhow, they're everywhere in SF. And laws protect them. Most states have laws where someone can ask if it's a service animal, but cannot ask for proof. So, some lapdog on the Muni tucked in a nurse's hoodie is a ""service animal"". My ass. That chihuahua provides you no disability service other than the tactile sensation of petting it, and the soothing of constant love and appreciation. 95% of serviced dogs belong to people have no physical disabilities, and are probably just mildly mentally screwy, but no clinical psychopathology (though I'm sure they'd be on benzos if they had their way).

I have registered therapy dog for patient visits & around the office.

You just demonstrate the dog is a good citizen & calm, obedient under public situations.  Training the dog takes time, but easy to pass test with a trained, socialized dog.   Elements for the test are available online.





If your dog can do those things, then check for a local AKC dog show that offers the test for a few dollars then you are all set with real credentials that will give you some legal basis if there is an adverse challenge to your dog.

Service dog if it IS a trained service dog, ie Seeing Eye Dog.  





Emotion Support dog if that is what it does, but stated for at home use only, such as for public housing.  I state the size & type / breed of dog & that the owner is responsible for any damages. I withhold the letter if, in my opinion, the patient is unable to care for the dog.  I advise training facilities available in the area.  The socialization for the dog & the patient is fantastic.





Therapy Dog is trained by the owner to provide comfort to other than the owner, ie nursing home visits, reading dogs for schools, etc.  I ask in advance if I can bring my dogs.  Usually people call me to please bring them. 


The biggest problem I have is finding places that will let me bring dogs in training.  They have to see / be places until they become very accustomed to sights, sounds, smells, unruly children, rude strangers.





Pets & or livestock:  Any animal.   Dogs want to be with us, work with us.  I don't know of another species that does. They make great pets & working dogs.  Others expect you to work for them (cats) or do something for them (livestock) or are wild animals who would rather be left alone (reptiles, amphibians, fish, virtually all other mammals)





I have trained some of my patients' dogs to walk with their owners who use walkers with instructions to the patients to walk the dog every day outside in good weather.  These elderly will walk their dogs for the dogs' sake even if they are reluctant to walk themselves (boring, too tired, etc.). ","4814475",1

As I moved through the facility some elderly people in wheelchairs started to gather and follow us down the hall. The crowd grew and soon I was in a low speed chase with a herd of wheelchair people. They petted my dog and told me stories about the pets they'd loved years ago. These people really had to work to move that far. These visits really do make a difference to these people.

"There are several types of designations for animals who are helping people. 


 


Service dogs: Must provide a service for the owner directly associated with his/her disability.  Used to mean seeing eye dogs, PALS dogs that usually aid people with mobility problems.  In the past several years this has been expanded to include dogs trained to detect onset of seizures, before they occur, hypoglycemia, breakdowns in people with PTSD.  these dogs must be allowed in any facility that allows the general public.  They are ALWAYS on lead unless their job requires that they be free.  I have a dog that was a breeding dog for Leader Dogs for the Blind.  She was not a service dog, but provided pups for Leader Dog.  LD made it clear that she could only go to those places allowed by any pet dog.





Therapy dogs are dogs certified by Therapy Dog associations to visit hospitals, nursing homes, schools and other facilities where the residents or students benefit by a visit with a friendly dog (and their owner).  They only go to rooms where their visit is requested.  They are ALWAYS on lead and under control by their handlers.  My dog, now retired from breeding, visits an assisted living facility.  According to the staff, she has brought patients out of their rooms and generally benefited some fairly lonely people.  She also goes to an inner city school where the kids read to her.  She doesn't criticism their efforts and the kids make some progress with their reading.  One of the schools in our small town has a Therapy Dog in residence at the middle school.  He has helped kids with school phobia, autistic kids with ""melt downs"" and was there for kids after a tornado hit the area.


Other uses for dogs, in bomb sniffing, etc. are under the care and control of professionals.





All other dogs are pet dogs, with no right to go anywhere that any other dog is allowed.  Unfortunately, there are always people that find a way to game the system.  My concern that these people will make it more difficult tor those with legitimate need for service dogs..","4814515",1

Afraid of running afoul of the ADA law, the nurse did so. After 30 minutes, she came out to the reception desk and demanded to be seen immediately. I was actually seeing pts scheduled before her but came out when she became belligerent and loud. She demanded that I see her immediately and that she and her dog would be in the exam room with her stopwatch on.





 I told her that in that case we would be happy to refer her to a vascular surgeon who could comply with her needs and wishes. I am not going to jeopardize my health and my ability to accommodate her need for emotional support. She was pi$$ed.

"I really should quit following this thread, but it is one of those topics that I can't get out of my craw. Two years ago the director of a community mental health center with which I work lost her dog to a natural death. She had allowed it to come daily to the clinic, supposedly to assist in psychotherapy. It didn't seem like a big deal as the dog was passive and after all, she was the director. Whether the dog really did much more than make a few children more comfortable, I cannot say. 





So she goes out and get this rescue animal to replace ""Lucy"". Turns out this adult mixed breed animal had probably been abused severely. She took it to some sort of training program, probably something like {redacted} did. Only this dog flunked. But by now she was attached to the dog, and he to her. It bit two people before we had to all step up an say enough. This dog's therapeutic value was less than marginal. Both the dog and the director are now gone. No more critters in the clinic.





I know the French let dogs into restaurants, but in our culture the fine line between a truly essential animal companion and a pet that's allowed to roam airports and food establishments under the guise of companion or therapy has been crossed. ","4820080",1

But I'd like the restaurant owner to be the one who makes the call. No business owner should have anyone else tell him whether he can, or can't, have a pet-free business. That should be his decision.





That's what galls me so much about the therapy pet bullshit. 99.9% of the time, the dog is a symptom of an illness, not a treatment. The illness is a mix of dependency and entitlement. 





Picture a sliding scale with dependency on one end and entitlement on the other:





Dependency -------------------------------------------------------------------- Entitlement 





All of these ""therapy pet"" patients are somewhere on that scale. The ones on the far left are needy and dependent and use the therapy pet as a transitional object, like a toddler has a blanket or a child has a favorite stuffed animal from which they cannot separate. That's age appropriate when a child does it, but when an adult does it, it's a sign of regressive emotional immaturity. 





And so the role of the psychologist or medial professional isn't to write a letter accommodating the transitional object; far from it, the role of the mental health professional is to help the patient overcome their illness! So quit writing these letters! Instead offer to send the patient to CBT for pet separation anxiety.





The people on the right end of the scale are simply entitled narcissists who think that other people's rules don't apply to them, and they want the doctor's letter both as validation (that other people's rules shouldn't apply because they're so special) and as a matter of convenience. The Sermoan who scams his dog onto flights for free seems to fall into this latter category. 





Most therapy pet people are somewhere in the middle.





Which is bad. Because it means you're about to deal with a morass of intractable dependent, emotionally regressed, entitled narcissism in someone who isn't emotionally mature enough to handle situations like an adult, but who simultaneously thinks that they're special and therefore rules don't apply.

Yes, already sensitised or reactive kids should avoid the allergen but since early this year peanut spreads are now being introduced before age 1 year to reduce peanut allergies.





There was a Middle Eastern study which found that when families gave a peanut spread to infants they had lower rates of developing peanut allergy.

"An allergy evaluation is essential for a few reasons. One tree nut allergy is often associated with a 40% chance of another nut allergy, even in those not botanically related. So it is a mistake to be dismayed that more than one nut allergy was examined. There is at one report from the Coroner's office in Ontario of an adult who was allergic to peanut, was tested only to peanut and presumed he was not allergic to tree nuts because he knew they were not botanically related, and died as a result of that misconception. As a pediatric allergist , I see that multiple tree nut allergies are the norm ( not just on testing but actual clinical reactions confirmed by testing). If there is a single nut allergy, it is either peanut ( a legume), or cashew/pistachio group, or brazilnut. Otherwise it is multiple nut allergies. By the way, your child is very unlikely to be allergic to raspberries ( not a significant allergen) and very unlikely to be peanul allergic ( your allergist can explain that). Because you are an MD, please do not feel you have the specialized knowledge to manage an anaphylactic food allergy - an allergist can guide you through the maze of avoidance measures, labelling issues, school issues etc. Cashew is the new emerging ananphylactic nut allergy and I predict it will become as important as peanut allergy. It is very unlikely to remit. While it belongs to the Mango/Anacardum family as does mango, pistachio and pink peppercorn, mango does not have to be avoided since it is the seed/nut that carries the nut allergen, not the flesh of the fruit. Pink peppercorn is a recently described novel allergen causing allergic reactions in some cashew allergic persons and is a novel spice used in some spice mixes and a common snack chip and is unrelated to black/white peppercorn.","4838430",1
"1. consider her allergic to cashew nut (and by association, pistachio - very close homogeneity between these allergens)


2. check for macadamia sIgE - and if positive consider her allergic to this also


3. Avoid  cashew, pistachio and macadamia (if +ive)


4. If macadamia sIgE is negative do an oral challenge with this food under the care of the paed allergist to confirm tolerance


5. continue to eat all other nuts, including peanut, unless and until evidence of clinical reactivity becomes clear.


6. fishing expeditions for sIgE to a range of other foods is not helpful because primary sensitisation (positive skin or blood test) is not evidence of secondary sensitisation (clinically relevant allergy). Avoidance of foods just because they show +ive on an allergy test may lead to development of true clinical allergy - i.e. progression from primary to secondary sensitisation. Continued exposure to a food that is currently tolerated - even if there is a +ive allergy test to that food - promotes the chances of continued tolerance","4838443",1

Retin A (tretinoin) also DOES NOT WORK for warts or molluscum and is totally ""off-label"" and has horrendous evidence based literature support.   I have frankly no idea why doctors use it.  I would rather offer frank voodoo than give patients bullshit therapy like that!     Please see my earlier post and quoted editorial on this subject:   https://app.sermo.com/posts/posts/251962     Not only is aldara/imiquimod ""off-label"",  it is NOT universally effective and can have significant adverse reactions and has little support for its use in the literature.    Contrary to what other doctors who have posted on this page,  I find cantheridin therapy to be fairly effective and certainly relatively safe and well tolerated.  It is easily the best therapy as far as tolerance goes and does not cause the tears and screaming that other more painful procedures produce.    Finally on my completely skeptical rant here as an experienced dermatologist who sees a lot of this problem,  I DO NOT use tagemet (cimetidine) therapy, and I believe that published studies on use of cimetidine have been more negative than positive again it is ""off label"" use and has poor quality level of support.     Listen,  I KNOW that warts and molluscum are annoying problems and I can understand why we reach for bullshit therapies to appease anxious parents who want us to do SOMETHING; but at a minimum,  I think we should not offer potentially harmful therapies (like imiquimod quite frankly!) and explain the benign nature of these lesions to parents and use less harmful therapies.





To answer post EBMFP DOC,  I would strongly push for light liquid Nitrogen to these lesions on your daughter if she could tolerate it.  I think if one treats more frequently say every week or two,  one can get on top of these lesions and get good cure rates.  But if one does a treatment,  then waits the usual month or two between treatment sessions,  the recurrent warts can be problematic.  A British study showing more frequent follow up intervals between cryotx treatments  say every 1-2 weeks had significantly better responses.  ","4977996",1

Every few years when a doctor or patient suggests cimetidine I will look at the research again and I think the research is clear that the benefits are minimal at best.

"Patient Case Submission: Help! Was This Child Abuse Or Not? Also posted as a Patient Case with four illustrations (https://app.sermo.com/posts/posts/343212):





The 20 September 2016 post, “At what point is it child abuse?” (https://app.sermo.com/posts/posts/335784) that discussed cigarette-smoking parents reminded me of a strange presentation of germline retinoblastoma in an unusual family. Many years ago, a little boy presented with unilateral retinoblastoma that was treated with enucleation. His mother came to me distaught because her husband had an affair with another woman who gave birth to a baby girl. Her mother would not take the baby girl for an eye examination. I called the family doctor, the only physician in their small town. He induced the mother to bring the baby to see us. A dilated eye examination did show bilateral retinoblastoma. Subsequent molecular mutation analysis show that the boy & his half-sister both carried the same germline RB1 gene mutation as their father, who did not have retinoblastoma. One day, the little girl came in covered with bruises. Her mother claimed that she was “battered” by her aggressive younger half-sister. The Oncology Social Worker, Suspected Child Abuse & Neglect (SCAN) Program, & Children’s Aid Society (CAS) were involved. Nothing was proved. Years later, the teenage girl confided in us that she was scared because her mother allowed her current partner to barge into the lockless bathroom while she was having a shower. A developmentally challenged lodger also had access to the lockless bedroom that she & her sister shared. At this time, Children’s Aid Society (CAS) acted. Her custody was awarded to her biological father & stepmother. The next time I saw the young teenager, she was a changed person. She was clean, happy & doing well at school. The corollary of the story was that I learned that her biological mother & her partner, & her biological father & stepmother all smoked. I counseled them all that individuals carrying a germline RB1 gene mutation had a lifelong risk of developing other cancers. They should avoid exposure to potential mutagens as much as possible. Alas, my advice to avoid smoking fell on deaf ears.

3) Rice Krispy treats that are  BOUGHT in a package as the brand-name Rice Krispy treats, made by Kellogg, do NOT contain any peanut material!

This makes their micronutrient to calorie ratio very high, which is why they are so healthy. And they are not devoid of macronutrients. In fact Kale and spinach have more protein per 100 calorie portion than most meats. The catch of course is per 100 calorie portion, not per ounce. But again, that's why they are so healthy. You can eat large volumes, feel full, get all those great micronutrients and protein, and loose weight.

"this is from a fruit and vegetable prescription program which I never new existed. interesting:





""Change your “home food environment.” You cannot increase your consumption of fruits and veggies if they’re not available or accessible. You must first buy them and keep them in sight. Be careful of hiding your fresh produce in refrigerator drawers until it spoils. Keep a list of your fresh produce on the refrigerator door. Prepare fresh fruits and veggies ahead of time if convenience is your biggest barrier. And avoid filling your house with other, more appealing options. If you’re desperately looking for a snack and your choices are: whole melon, bag of chips, or a packaged snack cake, which would you choose?


Anticipate how your family will respond to these dietary changes. You may be motivated enough to completely change your habits in a day, but if you’re also providing food for a family that complains about the veggie chunks in the new pasta sauce and the replacement of the potato chips with oranges, how long will you feel good about fruits and veggies?


Prioritize your time and spending. Re-evaluate what you are spending your time and money on now and how you will accommodate these new behaviors. This is where your knowledge of the health benefits of fruits and veggies is important. Spending money on fruits and vegetables to prevent chronic disease is often more cost effective in the long run than buying cheaper, less nutritious foods that contribute to obesity.


Gain the skills required to prepare meals and snacks that include more fruits and veggies. This will be a challenge in the beginning, but it gets easier with practice. For this type of skill-building, different people find different things helpful. If you need to build your cooking skills, the web is flooded with how-to videos. If you need meal and snack ideas, rummage through cookbooks, magazines, or Pinterest. The website for the Fruits and Veggies More Matters campaign is also full of great tips and advice.


Learn about your local farmers market. Farmers markets are becoming wildly popular as a resource for better tasting, more nutritious and affordable fresh fruits and veggies. This produce isn’t picked until it hits peak ripeness, which means peak flavor and nutrient content. Plus, it doesn’t have to travel far to get to you, which is good for the environment. And the guy who grew the produce is typically the same guy who sells it to you. He or she can tell you about any chemical fertilizers or pesticides used in the growing process. No confusing labels necessary.


Please continue to explore our blog, farmers market, and resources pages at http://portagecountycan.org/fvrx-program/ for more helpful information. And if you have input, questions, or comments about the program, please reach out to CentralWIFVRx@gmail.com.""","5059304",1

"As someone who has a PhD in nutritional biochemistry, I would like to share a few random thoughts:





1.  Nutritional knowledge is constantly evolving.  Much of what we think we know eventually is shown to be wrong.  For example, when I was in grad school, fat was bad, carbohydrates were good.  Companies came out with low-fat versions of processed foods, such as pastries, which substituted sugar calories for fat calories.  Not good.  The food pyramid recommended the consumption of large amounts of starchy food.  Not good.  Margarine was considered to be healthier than butter.  Not good.





2.  Pills do not make up for dietary deficiencies.  For example, many studies have shown that vitamin E supplements are at best, worthless.  (There may be exceptions to this, such as folate for women who might become pregnant and vitamin D for people who do not get a lot of sun exposure.)





3.  There are no ""superfoods.""  A balanced diet is more healthy than trying to eat kale and salmon every day.  Green tea and acai berries are not going to bestow health and longevity.





4.  More is not necessarily better.  For example, megadoses of selenium or vitamin B6 can produce serious toxicity.  Megadoses of vitamin C can be problematic for people who are prone to developing oxalate kidney stones.  Megadoses of zinc can interfere with copper absorption and cause a copper deficiency.





5.  There are many important nutrients that we don't know about yet.  For example, when I was in grad school phytonutrients, such as the pigments found in berries, were just being discovered.  I recently read that even iceberg lettuce has been shown to contain a healthful phytochemical, so one should not assume that, based on current knowledge, a particular food has no nutritional value.  Even coffee is a significant source of phytonutrients.





6.  Even ""bad"" foods can be eaten in moderation.  An occasional doughnut won't kill you.

They believe that food allergies trigger symptoms primarily in young children and environmental allergens play a greater role in older children and adults.

Originally I believe a simply descriptive term for patients who had the combination of asthma, allergic rhinitis/ conjunctivitis.

""".......IS ATOPIC DERMATITIS AN ATOPIC DISEASE?


Atopy is an environmentally influenced syndrome in which the primary immunological abnormality is the production of allergen-specific immunoglobulin E (IgE).5,6 The clinical image of massive facial oedema, urticaria, and pruritus minutes after eating a peanut in an individual with significant levels of IgE to peanut beautifully illustrates this definition. Entering the home of a cat-owner and, within minutes, sniffling, sneezing and wheezing also nicely paints the picture of an individual who is specifically sensitive to a cat antigen. But atopic dermatitis seems to defy this model with its non-immunological characteristics such as impaired skin barrier function, an often unpredictable course of waxing and waning, and up to two thirds of patients without any measurable allergen-specific IgE antibody.7–9





Indeed, the fact that atopic dermatitis is seen in patients with X linked agammaglobulinaemia—a state in which there is almost no IgE at all—seems to cement the notion that atopic dermatitis is not IgE-related, and thus not an atopic disease.1""

"Yougmc, how I handle A.D. depends on how severe it is.  Many cases of mild A.D. can be well-handled with applying a good moist. cream or ointment qd or BID to the affected areas, and occasional topical steroids for 1-4 days in a row for exacerbations that may occur once every 4-6 months. But application of moist. cream is easier-said-than-done. It takes TIME and energy to rub cream into the skin. Ointments take even longer to rub-in and skin still remains greasy (ointment- is essentially just Vaseline).   So, many parents and their children are too lazy or just have not carved-out the time in their daily routine to do daily moisturization.





Some children and teenagers still have frequent exacerbations or daily itching despite BID moisturizer application.  In these patients, I have them do PRO-ACTIVE or PREVENTIVE anti-inflammatory therapy-- this consists of applying a usually medium potency TOPICAL STEROID (I prefer the weaker medium potency agents) or CALCINEURIN INHIBITOR (Protpic, which is available generic now, and Elide, which does not have generic option)  REGULARLY, but not every day.  I mean 2-3 x per week (q2 days or q3 days) IN-ADDITION to daily moisturizer therapy.  I prefer that the patient do that then have exacerbations every 2 weeks and use a topical steroid EVERY DAY /BID for 7 days-at-a time every 2-3 weeks.  





I rec. some pts. take bleach baths in very dilute bleach in bath water twice per week.





I prefer not to perform food allergy skin testing on children with mild eczema/atopic dermatitis, but in some children with moderate-to-severe eczema/atopic dermatiitis,  I will do skin testing. Generally, I tell parents that what they have observed in-terms of which foods seem to make itch worse is actually more reliable than my skin prick testing.  One of the main reasons I don't like food prick testing in children with atopic dermatitis is because frequently you get multiple posiive test which DO NOT MEAN that the child actually has any problems/symptoms/allergic reactions to that food. I hate parents withholding certain foods just b/c an allergist did skin testing and the skin test was positive to peanut, soy, milk, and egg.  There is a good chance that the child could eat ALL those foods and not have any problems !  Children with eczema/atopic dermatitis often test positive on blood IgE testing or in-vivo IgE testing and those test results are often worthless. 





There are some pediatric patients, usually 8 yo or older, who need SYSTEMIC IMMUNOMODULATING agents b/c their atopic dermatitis is so severe that BID moisturizer application, bleach baths, and 2-3 days per week topical steroid or Protopic/Elidel application is not sufficient.  Of course, oral steroids are not a good long-term option, so that leaves us with the NON-STEROID systemic immunomodulating agents-- cyclosporin, tacrolimus, Cellcept, azathioprine, and hopefully in 2017 dupilumab.  Dupulimab should be a WONDER DRUG-- it is given SC q4 weeks and has very low risk of side effects. It should transform the treatment of moderate-to-severe A.D. Of course, it will be expensive.","5071504",1
"I have skin tested siblings with AD of many children with food allergies, limited panel of about 10 or so foods and if negative started them on regular feedings of peanuts and/ or hazelnut. Target age group is strictly 4-11 months. These siblings are doing very well maintaining tolerance so far and parents have been very satisfied. Any additional risk to the food allergic child is a strict end point for me. I inform parents as early as when pregnant to keep in mind this narrow window and to come in at the earliest sign of eczema, for an attempt at primary prevention of food allergies in the sibling. Although I am generally not an early adopter for new therapies, in these cases I have taken up early introduction of allergenic foods for my patients, as I am hoping this will contribute in some small way towards preventing food allergies in these atopic families.

"This is the best thing I've read from the NYTimes in a long time, and basically restates what I keep saying now that I've started to speak out.


You cannot single out one group without excluding another.


Period.


End of story.





Best single example in my personal life:  My child has celiac.  Because of this, we have difficulty participating in community activities of all stripes.  Sometimes we are allowed to bring her food, but more often - we aren't, so we just don't go.  Although we live in a kind community and people generally go out of the way to accommodate her at birthday parties, it's still rough for her.


We never complain and seldom ask for accommodations


I never ask for her to have special treatment, or for special programming for her.  


But it's hard for her.  


So when we got notice that the school was going to be doing special transgender programming and changing the school application for single child, I felt angry.  Really, really angry.  Not because they were trying to accommodate a kid, or trying to see ways to include the family in the community (all of which should be done) but because for three years, we've asked very little.  We've skipped community and youth events, and when we attended, we didn't feed our child.  In all that time, they've NEVER done programming about allergies or autoimmune diseases.  In fact, they don't even understand that celiac IS an autoimmune disease.


So I was ok with benign neglect.  I'm not ok with being ignored.  One is ok.  The other is discriminatory.


And this is in fact the point.  You can't scream about how much you want to include the LGBT kids and ignore all the kids with countless other life-altering issues.  We're ok if you teach acceptance and kindness.  We're not ok if you only teach acceptance and kindness towards one kind of person.","5128867",1
"Let's leave aside that being transgender is far more likely to get a kid bullied and beaten to a pulp than having celiac disease will and just look at your argument: your premise is that because you decided to do nothing - despite, frankly, being well-positioned as a doctor to help set something up, like an educational program -  that you are being discriminated against because someone else did  ask for  action for *their* kid for a different issue.





To that, I can only say ""huh ???""





If you had asked for help for your kid and been told to go suck an egg and then saw very differential treatment for the transgender kid you might have a point but you simply never indicated that you had a problem you wanted acted on administratively.





You were not being neglected - benignly or otherwise.  You were being silent about a need so it never reached the level of having that neglected - you simply left the impression that you were OK.





I would actually put real money on the school being responsive if parents of kids with celiac disease all got together with a set of reasonable requests to make it easier on their kids and I am sure that they would have been glad to have a doctor help them put together some information on the condition.





If this is your best example of the tyranny of identity politics  then I would aver that you are doing pretty well.

The other family apparently was not sanguine in that regard.  I can't say that either of you were right or wrong - you know your kids best - but merely that you approached things differently.





However, you only have discrimination if you are refused without a good reason while they are accommodated.

">> dominant culture <<





I'm glad you used that language, {redacted}, because I think relative social power between cultures is really what's going on here. Identity is the way these subcultures define themselves, but is the imbalance in social power that causes the friction.





I think the author is basically correct. I think two problems contribute, one from Clinton herself, and one from the left in general. On Clinton's side, she spoke clearly to the various minority identities that have had a home in the Democrat party for a generation, but didn't find a way to connect with the identity of the dominant culture, at least not in a way that let her win much territory outside the large, multicultural cities. For minorities, she offered a safe harbor, recognition, and affirmation. But for the dominant culture, she had... policies.





Meanwhile, many on the farther left, the ""woke"" left, talk about inclusivity, common ground, recognition, and equality, but they talk about social power as if it's a zero sum game. All of the ""check your privilege"" statements say to the dominant culture that inclusivity for minorities means diminishing their own power. The message isn't delivered in a way that elevates  subcultures to the same power level as the dominant culture, rather, it's that the dominant culture has to surrender power - and give it to factions that they often poorly understand.





Let's take Sermo's favorite topic, trans bathrooms.





Eventually people are going to recognize that trans is a real thing, and that trans men and women need to be given enough respect to use the bathroom without fear and harassment. Kind of like how things are in the big blue cities today. Here in my big blue city, nobody cares about trans bathrooms. That's a good thing, and it's because the city is big enough that people have had a chance to put names and faces to the idea of transgender, or they see so many cultures around them that they are like ""whatever."" So it's not a problem. So the social power of trans people is rising, but it's rising without anyone else feeling like they're giving anything up.





But meanwhile, there are towns out there where nobody has ever seen a transgendered person. So when they hear about Obama interpreting Title IX to put ""penises in girls' restrooms,"" they imagine horrible things. So to the dominant culture, it feels as if there's a tradeoff in power: the minority culture wins bathroom equality, while the dominant culture loses, and has to surrender control of their bathrooms to Washington and big-city social innovators.





If you see social power as a zero sum game, then it becomes natural to want to take down the dominant culture as you elevate minorities. But that's not going to win an election, which was the point of the article. You don't win an election by lecturing to the dominant culture about how it has to ""check its privilege.""





A better tactic would be to quit looking at social power in a zero-sum way. We can give more power to minorities without the dominant culture feeling like all that extra power for minorities comes at their expense. That was not something Clinton was able to communicate this election.

















","5128965",1
"The more risible overdoings of ""check your privilege"" were not the first step here. Those who hold the power are the ones who, at the first instance,  do not want to share that power - they were therefore the ones who treated it as a zero sum game.





Let's put aside the noisier folks and PCspeak - most people not currently in power just don't want to be treated inequitably.  That has built into it a willingness to share 50-50.  That however, still leaves it up to the current power holder to allow that, which is then - by definition -  inequitable because it is entirely up to them. 





For example, Jazz Jennings, a transgender kid who is really nice and has a really nice family tried doing outreach by a speaking tour and some people listened but some just called her filthy names.  Ultimately, she gets only the rights that the latter will permit her.





The more annoying language (that frankly sets my teeth on edge as well) can be eschewed but settling for no less than actual equality cannot be and if that creates discomfort then that is where the chips will have to fall, just as they did in the older struggles.





In any event, criticizing those still on the societal short end for not being accommodating enough seems to me to be a double whammy.





That having been said, I'm out for the next few hours.  I'll check in later.

Eating out is all but impossible and every label has to be read.  That said, I hear your message.  Many people have specific extenuating problems but there is a certain social responsibility that comes with dealing with one's own issues and not demanding that the rest of the world change (often at great expense).   School budgets are limited.  By the time we spend the whole budget ""accommodating"" every demand, there is not enough left for core functions.  If a kid shows up without breakfast, that is the fault of the parent and it is unreasonable burden on schools that they have to provide them the meal.  I recall an effort by Public Aid to force physicians to find and pay for a translator upon demand for most any language.  This got discontinued when doctors began dropping out - and the choice had to be made between provision of some services for all, or everything for a few.


The socialist vision is one in which all resources are centralized and disbursed based on what some authority determines to be need.  Market based societies use money to allocate goods and services.  Gluten free products cost more - a lot more.  And we buy them with our money.  We don't demand the store price it down to par with everything else, or that some program provide it.

I'm not arguing against equality; what I'm saying (and what the author of the NYT article is saying) is that the Democrats in this election cycle created enough discomfort in the dominant culture that Trump could walk in as their comforter and win easily. The Democrats didn't court the dominant culture, they alienated it.





The future electoral solution for the Democrats and the left would be to pull back from strident critique of the dominant culture as a pathway for minority inclusivity, and instead articulate a vision of radical inclusivity that doesn't require self-flagellation on the part of the dominant culture.

The thematic villain in that discussion is the white man demanding cultural submission of the dominant native culture of this hemisphere, depicted as noble and hapless.   There are many heroes and villains, but there is also no going back. It was a tragic collision of two different worlds.

I changed Dr. Dodell's letter as follows:





To my dear patients,





This has been a wonderful time to be an American. I will never forget my walk to my office on the morning after the election; I have never felt the nation so full of hope. The last 8 years has brought out the worst in many. I have seen its ramifications in people’s health and hope that it no longer has an impact. I want to express my goal during this time and beyond.





Let me be clear, every patient that walks into my office will receive my best. This is the oath I have taken. This is my professional obligation.





I cherish the doctor-patient relationship. For me, the practice of medicine is about the whole person, not just lab results or vital signs. For this reason, I inquire about relationships, work life, stress, and beyond. I believe that these facets of your life impact your health. I am honored that you have shared these intricate details of your life and trusted me with that information and your care. There is no doubt that the majority of us have been impacted by this election, and it appears this will continue to be a wonderful transition.





There is a reason the saying “xxx is making me sick” exists. Well, the maltreatment of patriotic Americans across this nation is beyond disheartening. It may impact sleep, increase blood pressure, and blood sugar so we must continue to have an open dialogue about its impact on you. You can be sure, that I am feeling its effects. I am here for you! Let’s do our best together.





I can’t begin to imagine what some of you have gone through. I will listen and support you to the best of my ability. I want all my patients to feel that they are in a place where they can be open and comfortable, because that is what you deserve as human beings.





I have fought for the sacred patient-physician relationship because I believe that everyone has the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. There have been many things to be proud of as an American these days, and one that strikes close to home is increasing access to Direct Primary Care for personalized health care all Americans desire and deserve. Among many positives which will come from this change of leadership, I hope it is an improvement in the foundation of our health care system. Let us all stand together to achieve this goal.

They should have just waited a week and they would have seen that he is just going to be another tool of the 1% , hiring Streeters for Treasury, a corporate privatizer for Education and the ""king of bankruptcy"" for Commerce.





IOW - they saw him as what he presented himself as: something new and outside the political mainstream.

What is a target pistol? Any pistol with which one shoots at a target (I assume you know the difference between a pistol and a revolver). Thus, a target pistol is a .22 rim fire or a 9 mm or a .45 acp or a .50 Dessert Eagle, all of which vary tremendously in muzzle energy, and all of which can be used for multiple other purposes, including self defense and assaulting other people, including enemy combatants. The two most popular civilian pistols by far are those using the 9 mm parabellum and the .45 acp, which happen to be the two most used rounds in the U S military.





If you don't wish to distinguish between pistols and revolvers, and simply prefer to talk about handguns, then a ""target"" revolver includes the Smith .500, which has more muzzle energy than the standard AR-15 round, and about as much as a .308. It will readily kill a grizzly bear, but can also be used for target shooting. Go figure.





What is an assault rifle? Any rifle with which one assaults.  


The standard AR-15 uses a 5.56 mm round, which is far less in power than the 30-06 or the .308, two popular hunting rounds. In fact, the 5.56 mm round has less power than the Swedish Mauser 6.5 mm round, a military rifle first used in 1898; and less power than the 7.5 mm French MAS 36, a military rifle used by the French in 1936; and less power than the German 8 mm Mauser used in the Second World War.  And gosh and golly, guess what? The 6.5 mm and the 7.5 mm and the 8 mm were all ASSAULT RIFLES. As was the Brown Bess. An assault rifle is any rifle used in assault which, in these last four instances, were enemy soldiers.





I suppose you are fine with the M-1 Garand, because it is semi-auto and has a maximum capacity of 8 rounds. Of course, it does fire the .30-06, and can be reloaded in about 3 seconds... so there is that.





And good luck converting an AR-15 from a semi-auto to a full auto. Even most ""gun nuts"" can't do that, since it requires precision machining of the lower receiver trigger housing group well, not to mention access to the special sere and hammer necessary for it to function in the auto mode, plus the proper bolt carrier that allows engagement of the full auto sere.





""...doesn't matter how many kids die in this country, they don't give a shit.""  Now there's an intelligent statement, {redacted}. Of course I don't care about kids dying of gunshot wounds. After all, how could I? I own guns. (By the way, don't these stats about kids include as ""kids"" anyone under age 18? But, who ever heard of criminals under age 18? Just doesn't happen.)

Almost any solid round fired from a rifle for deer hunting will penetrate the body armor typically worn by police officers.





As to your follow-up post, a 12 gauge pump shotgun with buckshot is potentially more dangerous than a semi-auto rifle in a number of scenarios.





Magazines that carry a specific number of rounds are a common target for people who wish to lessen gun violence.  On the surface this seems a reasonable notion; fewer rounds in the gun, less carnage.   However, in real-world scenarios, it takes seconds for someone with minimal practice to change magazines on most weapons; thus negating the apparent benefit.

The platforms for assault style rifles like the AR 15/M16 are, and I would hazard a guess  play directly into the sick fantasies of the lunatics who  engage in mass shootings. Probably much more stimulating/validating for one of these folks to hold a military style weapon than a manifestly civilian one---different mindset, you know?","5145036",1
"One of the problems a lot of us on this side of the creek have when it comes to discussions of banning certain types of firearms is that often times the guns in question operate in the same manner and fire the same cartridges (or weaker as is the case with most AR's) than a number of ""legitimate"" hunting and recreational firearms.  Apart from the fact that AR-style rifles are increasingly popular for hunting, what's the point in banning something no more, and in some cases less, lethal than what the non-shooting public considers ""legitimate""?  If the rational in elimination is lethality and not emotion, how can one then not ban the others?





The aura of an AR-style weapon is a legitimate point.  There are some who will buy one simply because they view it as macho.  However, is it the machismo of the gun that induces murder or is a murderer simply choosing a more macho weapon and would just as readily use another if his first choice is not available?





Two further points I ask you to consider.  Even if one doesn't think it difficult enough, it's harder now to buy a gun legally than at any point in the nation's history yet we still have a sizable number of gun related crimes committed yearly.  It might not be the gun that's the problem.  Likewise, there are several hundred million guns in private hands in the US.  If it was made illegal to buy a gun tomorrow, we are still left with that number.  The only thing I can imagine which would make any realistic difference is to begin confiscating guns.  Whose do we get?  I have no issue with the notion of background checks ( they are already a requirement for most gun purchases) provided they are done properly.  I have no issue with measures being taken to prevent the mentally inappropriate from gaining access to guns provided that can be done in an appropriate manner.  I do believe, though, that nothing of significance will change until the 800lb gorilla of a few hundred million guns out here is addressed.  I'm opposed to the notion of taking legally-acquired firearms from mentally competent, law-abiding citizens.   Yet what else from the side of gun control would make any real difference?

"If you could own a pistol, a rifle, and a shotgun,{redacted}, what would you choose for each? 





Beyond the pale for what? Private citizen ownership in an area that is routinely peaceful? Where you don't need to lock your car or your home? For me in that environment I wouldn't see the need for an M-2 machine gun or an M-79 grenade launcher or a LAAW or an RPG, or an 81 mms mortar. And definitely no use for a tacnuke or a railgun.","5145553",1
"Points well taken. The issue is bimodal:
1) those weapons/systems expressly designed for multiple human and/or area killings, generally military in origin and historically favored by mass shooters
2) those weapons/systems  designed for single/selective human killings, not necessarily military in origin and sometimes appropriate for home or personal defense. 

Obviously this is not perfect; a sniper rifle for instance would ""belong ""in the first category but have aspects of the second.

The vast majority of homicides in the US are, as you pointed out attributable to the second category, namely handguns, which are widespread. 

It would seem to me that the two categories would demand different approaches. 

If we are talking about tight restriction and draconian regulation, this approach would be most appropriately applied to the first category--which, by the way, is supported by the heller decision as well as data from mass shootings of recent years. 

Moderating the carnage of the second category would I think require a more nuanced approach and tools might include: stringent enforcement of existing regulations, limitation of unregulated or less enforceable venues of obtaining these weapons, restriction of the use of munitions designed for enhanced lethality, Community education and buyback programs, linking of active substance abuse disorders to ineligibility for purchase/ownership, holding manufacturers accountable for developing weapons with advanced safety features (? owner/fingerprint recognition) and rendering them financially liable for a percentage of the social costs of their products, creative penalties for firearms violations or firearm-related crimes (open to suggestions) for starters.","5145675",1

"An answer to your question, I don't know much about rifles and shotguns, and I can't think of any need that I would have for either. I did once spend a weekend at a Family hunting cabin with a girlfriend during residency. She had a shotgun there in case of bears or rabid raccoons, though I think her dad would have preferred another use for it.","5145745",1
"As to pistols, I am again no expert, but I did once own one: a Beretta 9 mm semi automatic. More of a social thing when I worked in a ""gun culture"" area of the country. Took the required safety course, registration, had a carry permit etc., did target practice at a local range with an instructor. It was fun. Then my wife and I had our first kid and for me the entire calculus changed. I got rid of it and haven't had one since. ","5145771",1
"I think placing the onus on the penalty aspect is a more realistic approach with the understanding that some people should not be allowed to own a gun in the first place.  Making  a gun usable only by it's owner sounds great on paper but the technology doesn't yet exist to guarantee that such won't fail when the owner needs it in a life-threatening situation.  I have no issue with a purely voluntary buy back provided the funds can be found without raising someone's taxes. I still have reservations about restrictions in general.  The ""sniper rifle"" of which you speak is what most of us use for deer/elk/sheep/etc hunting.  Bullets with enhanced lethality help insure a more humane kill when hunting.  There's a great deal of crossover between what a non-shooter would consider ""legitimate"" and what might appear inappropriate in another context. 





I don't pretend to have an answer to gun violence in America.  We are an inherently violent culture.  Violence is glorified in our entertainment.

"Interesting thoughts, {redacted}.. I now own several AR-15 type rifles (actually M-4's, but not full auto) and a few AR-10's. All of these were built from scratch. I have used M-16's and others AR type rifles since 1969. Never, since Vietnam, have I ever used any of them with lethal intent, and I do not like being lumped in the category of that extremely small number of people who have used them for criminal purposes. Why I should be penalized for the actions of that minority is beyond me. I have also raised 6 boys while being an active owner of handguns, shotguns, and long guns. Safe storage is very simple, and I never worried about them getting one. Later, by age 8, each was carefully trained by me in their safe and careful use. All 6 are now highly proficient--- not to mention safe and responsible--- and those with children are meticulous about safe storage. And none of them--- including the one who  served in Africa and Iraq using weapons with lethal intent--- deserve to be lumped into that category of criminal users, either.





Obviously my calculus, and that of my sons, is much different than yours--- and that's fine. What isn't fine is the belief that my legal ownership puts others at risk.





As far as ""... holding manufacturers accountable for developing weapons with advanced safety features (? owner/fingerprint recognition) and rendering them financially liable for a percentage of the social costs of their products ..."" go, there are no good reasons for this except as a means to shut down small arms manufacturers. ""Advanced safety features"" are unnecessary, if made must be completely discretionary for each owner to add to his firearm if he so desires, and if used must be understood to be inherently capable of failure. Making gun manufacturers ""financially liable for a percentage of the social costs of their products"" is as irrational as making a car manufacturer liable for auto accidents.","5146923",1

He  was sent to another airport and they were beside themselves with worry and concern. They got him back many many hours later , urine soaked in his crate and really freaked out.

Frankly, I think your child is the one that should stay home.  They actually ARE seriously disabled if a cute dog scares them.  They need psychiatric help.  Maybe they shouldn't leave the house if they can't handle a pet.





Also, I have been bothered by shrieking kids way more than anybody's pets.  I think that if your child shrieks or if your baby cries incessantly, you should automatically be upgraded to the first class seat price.  Additional money collected from you should be distributed equally to your seatmates.  There is absolutely no need to fly with an infant.  It bothers me.

"Glad to see my annoyance is shared by many.
There are a significant number of dogs at the hotel too...wearing their little emotional support vests.  
Ultimately:  the best way, IMO, to think of public spaces and our utilization is this: is there a reasonable expectation of privacy / quiet / noise / children / adults / pets / etc? If so, behavior should be targeted towards that norm.  In a park, on a street...my kid has to deal with the dogs.  Just as you expect Friendly's to be noisy and kid-filled...and you should expect flights to vacation destinations to be kid filled around school breaks...kids are not expected in a sauna or a Michelin-starred restaurant.  Knowing the basic behaviors expected - and making an effort to meet those standards - is simply a matter of civility.  Do we all succeed?  Absolutely not.  But we share space on this earth together, and we should all try.
And for the record, my kid did not scream.  Or shriek.  Or throw a tantrum.  

","5184895",1
"Agreed with above.  I would add that as the only means of transportation cross country, I would expect to see dogs in the airport and on the plane, appropriately in their container on the plane and on a leash in the airport.





The kid example is because I have been on 2 red-eye flights recently seated 2 rows away from a baby and/or a toddler.  The baby wasn't too terribly bad.  Quietly cried for about an hour and then was okay.  The toddler kept shrieking so loudly that it was actually physically hurting my ears.  Not to mention I didn't get any sleep because of it.  Talk about breaking societal standards.  Even the flight attendants turned the lights off and didn't come through for meal/snack service because people are supposed to be asleep then.  Why in the world would you fly across the country with a toddler at midnight and without any distracting entertainment?  A quiet dog shouldn't bother anybody.","5184962",1
"....except a) only real service dogs are quiet (one was barking so loudly in the terminal we could hear it from some distance away).  b) some people have fears / allergies.  c)  One dog was off leash and running around the terminal.  d)  none of these dogs were crated and e) two were larger than my children (and they're tall - the ten year old is 5'2"").  Crated, short leash - I'd have much less of an issue.  I still think the general point is that most of these ""emotional support dogs"" are bullshit.  





The point is:  It's an inconvenience to leave your pet, crate him/her, or keep him/her on a short leash; and it's an inconvenience to adjust your actions to minimally impact those around you, but the world isn't designed around us as individuals, and not everyone will love Fido as much as you do.  If it were, in my world, airplanes would serve delicious, gluten free meals, peanut butter would be permitted for all children under ten, there would be a special dispensation for children who must jog up and down the aisle, and I wouldn't have to get to the airport three hours early.





These statements are, of course, ridiculous, and that's the point.  I wouldn't dream of asking an airline to accommodate those requests





By the way, anyone who thinks traveling with toddlers is fun, or that parents enjoy it, needs to have their head examined.  It's one of those things you do because you have no other choice.  I can't tell you why someone took a red eye.  Maybe it's all the parent could afford.  Maybe someone died at home.  You never know.
